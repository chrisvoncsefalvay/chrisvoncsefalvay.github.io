It is relatively trivial to teach a computer to be relatively good at chess or checkers or even go. On the other hand, getting a computer to master, say, bipedal motion is actually very, very tricky. There are multiple reasons behind this, including that the human brain is the pinnacle of an evolutionary pathway that spans the course of millions of years of optimisation for certain kinds of tasks, such as bipedal motion. We are an ‘opinionated’ system: we evolved with the idea that we’ll be solving certain kinds of problems, and not others. The evolutionary incentive for chess has been relatively modest compared to the evolutionary incentive to be able to run away from a sabre tooth cat or some prehistoric predator. Our brains have evolved through millions of years of exposure to certain senses: vision, balance, proprioception, pressure/pain, and so on. Without so much as wasting a single thought, our brain performs the process of sensor fusion and generating an operating model of where we are in space with accuracy that is really not trivial for computers even today. And we’re really good at this before we’re old enough to know just what an amazing nervous system we have. You really do not realise what a fantastic thing the human central nervous system is until it starts malfunctioning.\n\nRead the full answer here."

    "text": "Will true AI come before the ability to completely simulate a human brain? Is there a difference?\n\nSimulating the human brain is a fairly pointless exercise. You see, the human brain is a functionally extremely diverse thing. You see this best when you consider what damage to it can cause: some brain injuries cause mood disorders, some cause memory disorders, some cause aphasia (speech disorders), some cause issues with mobility and motor control, some cause severe disorders of consciousness like persistent vegetative states and minimally conscious states. The brain is basically a bunch of histologically largely similar tissue that does a lot of different things. There’s not a lot of point in simulating these functions.\nA bigger problem, though, is that some things are a lot harder to ‘simulate’ than others. This is something widely known as Moravec’s paradox: it’s a lot easier to teach a computer to play chess at a pretty high level than to teach it simple bipedal human motion. For this reason, simulating the human brain has generally been seen as not all that much of a priority. Connectionism is great, but it’s largely an inspiration, not a one-to-one reality. Many get this wrong because of concepts like neural networks and artificial neurons. In reality, a neural network is an abstraction to help humans. On the code level, there aren’t individual neurons or layers, there is just a bunch of relatively trivial linear algebra going on. I know I’m oversimplifying a little, but that’s the general idea.\n\nRead the full answer here."

I live in Denver, a city with a major but not first-in-line international airport (e.g. not like Heathrow or LAX, but a pretty nice airport no less, despite the creepy murals). Just as a thought experiment, I sometimes pick random places on the planet and look at how long it would take me to get there. It’s virtually never more than 48 hours.\nTo prove this point: it’s a little before 8am on a Sunday here. I can be:\n…in Ürümqi, China, in about 35 hours, …in Makassar City, Sulawesi, Indonesia, in about 33 to 42 hours, …in Maputo, Mozambique, in about 29 to 35 hours, depending on airline, …in Itahanga, Mato Grosso, Brazil, in about 44 hours, if I drove straight from Manaus, or 34 hours if I flew into Brasilia.\nI do these thought experiments all the time when I wonder about the thing you’re asking yourself.

In fact, I’d be extremely surprised if that weren’t the case.\nLet me take a slight detour here to a concept that might be more familiar. You’ve heard of supershedding and superspreading, right? We’re instinctively geared to consider things like that to be extraordinary phenomena, the same way some people who could hold an HIV infection without developing AIDS were known as “elite controllers” for a long time (today, the term is “long-term non-progressor”, which is much less cool, sadly). But the reality is, they’re not. They’re the (often quite fat) tails of a distribution. Here’s something that doesn’t come to you naturally, something you need to force your brain to wrap itself around as you start doing epidemiology: all the numbers you encounter talk about the central tendency, but say relatively little about the distribution.\nLet me expand on that a little. What’s the mean infectious period of COVID-19? If you ask someone who has a relatively good grasp of the subject, they’ll say it’s around 9–10 days, with an interquartile range of around 4–12 days, give or take one day each way. That term – “interquartile range” – means that given a sample, half of the values will be in that range. Or, more importantly, half of the values will be outside that range.\n\nRead the full answer here."

    "text": "Native Americans were devastated by European diseases brought by colonizers, but were the colonialists impacted by new diseases not found in Europe?\n\nYes, with a significant difference: the Americas had a population density nowhere near that of urban Europe, where many of the colonists came from. Europe is tiny, and very interconnected. The result of that is that pathogenic diversity is going to be off the charts. It’s not even that Europeans brought various epidemics into the Americas, whose populations were largely naive to those pathogens (a phenomenon widely known as a ‘virgin soil epidemic’, much as I loathe the term) – it’s that they bought hundreds of different versions of it. They brought that into societies that, at least where North America was concerned, lived in a way that is very significantly more resilient to pathogens: in small(ish) groups, often as part of extended families (i.e. often similar profiles of immunity), spread out. In a profound sense, Old World epidemics are the result of a peculiarly (but not exclusively) Old World phenomenon: the Big City (“big”, here, being generally relative to total populations). When colonists moved to the Americas, they bought a piece of that Big City’s pathogenic diversity with them, to populations that have neither been exposed to that particular microbiome, nor have generally been under the evolutionary pressure to select for better genetic predispositions to develop immunity to a wide range of pathogens, since that just wasn’t much of a thing in the New World.\n\nRead the full answer here."

    "text": "The flu has been around since 1918. Why are the vaccines against Covid, which is much newer and more harmful, so much more effective than the flu vaccines? Is there any hope for a ‘universal flu vaccine’ (as there is for a ‘universal Covid vaccine’)?\n\nInfluenzaviruses have been around for much longer than since 1918. Greek physicians from the 5th century BC have documented what is almost definitely influenza. Influenza A and B viruses have differentiated around 2,000 years ago, but both trace their origins to a common ancestor around 8,000 years or so ago, give or take a few thousand years (molecular clocking gets tricky after some time). More importantly, however, influenza has a level of diversity that far exceeds SARS-CoV-2.\nInfluenzaviruses are actually not a single pathogen, but four genera of the family orthomyxoviridae, each of which comprises a single species: we refer to these as influenzaviruses A, B, C and D. These are viral species in their own right. A, B and C are human pathogenic, and A is responsible for pandemic influenza. Influenzaviruses then break down into serotypes. When you see something like H1N1, that’s a subtype – it denotes the type of two major surface proteins, haemagglutinin (the number after H) and neuraminidase (the number after N) expressed by the virion. Influenza A virus is incredibly genetically diverse, and mutates rapidly. This creates a kind of diversity and versatility that makes it hard to vaccinate against.\n\nRead the full answer here."

    "text": "Why are infectious diseases with high mortality rates not as infectious as those with lower mortality rates?\n\nThere’s a theory that underlies this observation, widely known as the ‘avirulence hypothesis’ aka ‘trade-off theory’ (which I discuss in my book on p.164). The idea is that from the perspective of the pathogen, virulence (the detrimental effect of the pathogen on the human) is quite epiphenomenal. The pathogen does not get an evolutionary advantage out of harming the host. Some of the most widely spread viruses, for instance, cause no symptoms at all in the overwhelming majority of people. My favourite, JC virus, is present in about 50–70% of all people worldwide, and generally does not cause symptoms unless the person in question is immunosuppressed (at which point, sadly, it can cause some dreadful consequences – progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, which occurs in HIV/AIDS and with the use of certain medications for neuroautoimmune disorders that reduce immune system activity in the brain, is caused by JC virus reactivation, and is pretty unpleasant). Ubiquitous viruses like EBV and some herpesviruses are generally very indolent, to the point of being asymptomatic in many cases. In some instances, they might even be beneficial – gammaherpesviruses are associated, at least in animal models, with an increased resistance to Y. pestis and Listeria monocytogenes.\n\nRead the full answer here.

And this is one of the bigger travesties of the world.\n\n\nUnfortunately, humans are what they are, and the two superpowers, the US and the USSR at the time, decided that each would be allowed to keep actual smallpox samples. The last outbreak of smallpox was not ‘natural’ but a laboratory escape, killing a medical photographer, Janet Parker, in 1978. In 1984, the WHO authorised two labs – VECTOR in Koltsovo, USSR, and the CDC in Atlanta – to store samples of it.

Equally, I used to think primarily in Hungarian as a child (the language we spoke at home most of the time), but increasingly found I had a hard time expressing certain ideas.

I can recognise it even if you speak it very faintly. I may not even be able to understand individual words, but there’s a ‘rhythm’ and ‘tonality’ to it that you can understand. The best analogy is this: say you’ve listened to your fair share of modern minimalist composers. If I gave you a new Philip Glass soundtrack, you’d immediately recognise it. There are some motifs that are just ‘so Glass’. This actually goes beyond identifying the language and starts to involve the semantic layer.

What can be done about this issue?\n\nI worked for a Big Law firm. To say we charged like doctors is a gross insult. Very few doctors charge remotely what we did.\nThere’s a quite simple reason for why that’s the case: spending seven figures (or more) with us could save a company from being sunk by a lawsuit. Think about that for a moment. We routinely acted in matters where tens or hundreds of millions were at stake, and often enough, much more. The amount of money at play in such high stakes matters is orders of magnitude beyond whatever impact an individual physician may generate. You don’t have to like this fact of life, but that doesn’t make it any less a fact of life.\n\nRead the full answer here."

    "text": "If the UK were invaded, would it be legal in UK law for a civilian to murder an enemy combatant if the opportunity presented itself?\n\nThe laws of war basically separate people in two classes – combatants and non-combatants. A combatant cannot be prosecuted for the lawful conduct of hostilities which, yes, involves killing the other side’s combatants (they can, however, be prosecuted for war crimes). They are entitled to the panoply of rights that combatants have upon becoming non-combatants by way of surrender or becoming hors de combat, such as being wounded. On the other hand, a combatant can generally be killed with pretty little justification – if the kill is legal (the person is a combatant at the time, and the kill did not involve perfidy or some other form of illegality), it is what it is.\nNon-combatants enjoy extensive privileges in contrast. Not only are they entitled to protection, even if they are living in occupied areas, they are also categorically not permissible targets for military action. They and their property enjoy extensive protections. They cannot generally be interned against their will unless they are prisoners of war, they cannot generally be forced to work and there are various other protections they enjoy. Most of all, they cannot be killed for no reason other than not liking the occupying power.\nThis gets complex where someone decides they’re going to blur the lines.\n\nRead the full answer here."

This is not, actually, a necessary implication. Constitutions can be superordinate norms and it makes sense for them to be so. On the other hand, they don’t have to, nor is it a necessary implication of a constitution that it should be a superordinate norm. Nor do written and codified constitutions exclude reliance on other norms that happen not to be written and codified. An example would be constitutional conventions, which are basically political customs – plenty of countries with proper, codified constitutions have them. For instance, Germany has a codified constitution (even if it is not called a constitution but a Basic Law, for historical reasons), but that doesn’t provide for who gets to nominate the President of the Bundestag in the circumstances where a party has a plurality but is in opposition. It turns out that in this case, it would still be the largest party that would get to provide the President of the Bundestag, i.e. there’s no horse-trading between coalition parties to have a joint candidate for President of the Bundestag.

    "text": "Don’t American law students study the famously unwritten British Constitution? Are the details superfluous?\n\nThe British constitution is very much written.* It’s not codified. There’s a difference. For instance, nobody would argue that the Human Rights Act 1998 isn’t part of the British constitutional order, and last I checked, it’s pretty darn written. What it isn’t is codified, meaning there isn’t a single constitutional document.\nPart of the reason for this is that we do not have coequal branches of government. The UK has legislative supremacy, i.e. Parliament is not fettered by the judiciary. There’s no such thing as judicial review of primary legislation (as opposed to secondary legislation aka statutory instruments, and administrative action) the way there is in the US post-Marbury v Madison. Therefore, there’s no real need — or use — for a superordinate norm against which legislation may be tested. John Griffith said “the constitution is what happens … if it works, it’s constitutional”. The lecture (and later article) in which he made this poignant remark was titled The Political Constitution, which I think is a great way of describing the UK’s constitutional order.\n\nRead the full answer here."

    "text": "Is law school intrinsically worth it? Even if you don’t become a lawyer, is it worth it to go through the process of law school?\n\nThe common perception is that law school is spent studying the law. This is maybe true in the vaguest outlines. Let me give you an example: like everyone pursuing a qualifying law degree in England and Wales, I had to take criminal law. Part of that was learning the elements of certain offences. I know to this date that theft is the (1) dishonest (2) appropriation of (3) property (4) belonging to another (5) with intent to permanently deprive. Would I actually know how to defend a theft charge? Probably not. How each of these parameters are applied in practice is not a lot like what you learn in law school.\nYou do, however, learn a lot about reasoning. For instance, ‘dishonesty’ is an element of the offence. In England and Wales, a finding of dishonesty requires both a subjective and objective element (R v Ghosh), i.e. not only does your action have to be something others would consider dishonest, but it must also be something you yourself would consider dishonest. How would one arrive at that finding? How would one make the pleading for that? Would, say, someone believing that they are enriching themselves unjustly qualify?\n\nRead the full answer here."

    "text": "Do mathematicians use advanced terminology?\n\nAs you move towards more advanced maths, it becomes less about dealing with numbers and stuff, and more about logical manipulations of various concepts. We want a convenient way to refer to certain things for which certain statements are true. To give you an example you are likely familiar with: we could say “x is a member of the set of integers greater than one that is not the product of two natural numbers”. Or, we could just say “x is [a] prime”. This is useful when you have to describe more complex things. A group, for instance, is a construct that consists of a set and an operation. A set and an operation are a group if they exhibit the group axioms — properties that are the “requirements” for a group. What these are are not so relevant here as the fact that life is a whole lot easier for us if we can simply say “group” and know that everyone else will know what we’re talking about, including, importantly, what specific features this thing we allege is a group would exhibit, from which we can then derive various other properties. For instance, one property of a group is that the operation is “closed”, meaning that performing the operation on any elements of the set will give you another element of the set. We know that addition of integers is a group (the set is the set of integers, the operation is addition). Consequently, we have proved that if x and y are integers, so will x + y be an integer. Trivial, yes, but it gets much more complicated quite quickly.\nMany of these concepts are, essentially, sets of rules and conditions. Often, they’re subspecies: an Abelian group is a group that satisfies some specific criteria. A ring is a kind of Abelian group that meets some additional criteria. And so on. Mathematical terminology is intended to capture these logical distinctions in a sort of shorthand.\n\nRead the full answer here."

The problem is that the brain does not have a lot of tolerance for swelling, and therefore pretty much any inflammation in the brain is going to be a massive problem.\nThe reason why PAM is the worst kind of meningoencephalitis is because the pathogen involved, N. fowlerii, is extremely difficult to kill. Naegleriasis is an amoebiasis rather than a bacterial infection, meaning that the usual method of solving problems – throw antibiotics at it – doesn’t really work. The most effective drug until recently used to be amphotericin B, which is notorious enough for its side effect profile to be nicknamed ‘amphoterrible’.

It’s not the most unpleasant drug in the infectious disease arsenal, because our friends in Infectious Diseases have things like literal arsenic in antifreeze (melarsoprol), but it’s pretty bad. And that’s before dealing with the problem of actually getting it to the site of the action, which often requires intrathecal administration (into the spinal canal), which has an entire set of issues on its own.

The idea of a PET scan is something along these lines: a radiotracer that undergoes ß+ decay is injected, and accumulates where the tracer is taken up (this depends on the tracer and the physiology being imaged). As the tracer undergoes ß+ decay, it emits positrons (thence the PE – ‘positron emission’ – part of the name). When positrons hit electrons, they annihilate and emit a gamma photon. This is then imaged using a gamma camera, which basically measures the intensity of light,* in this case, gamma light. The result is a picture of how much gamma light is emitted from any point in space, thanks to a nifty little thing called an inverse Radon transform (that’s ruh-DOWN as opposed to ray-DOWN, which is how you are supposed to pronounce the element, to which it’s entirely unrelated).\nNow, I’ve gone through this length to explain how the image is acquired because it helps us understand what the image is (which is always something you should have at the forefront in medical imaging). It’s an image of signal intensity attributable to a point in three-dimensional space (although we obviously look at 2-dimensional projections of it), where that signal intensity is the measure of the amount of ß+ decay originating from that point, which in turn is a measure of how much of the tracer is taken up by tissue at that point, which in turn is biologically meaningful (e.g. if the tracer is 18fluoro-deoxyglucose, which is a radiotagged sugar, it will show areas of higher glucose metabolism). In other words, for any point in space (and therefore, for any projection thereof), we have one value for any point in space.\n\nRead the full answer here."

    "text": "What would happen to your body if you’re exposed to 10 times the magnetic power (30T) of an MRI scanner?\n\nMost of the weird and/or unpleasant things that tend to happen in a properly operated MRI (by which I mean nobody is letting the guy with all the spinal hardware into the scanner room) don’t actually happen due to the static magnetic field. In MRIspeak, that’s normally denoted \\(B_0\\). If you read MRI safety literature, you’ll see another symbol a whole lot more: \\(\\frac{dB}{dt}\\), known to its friends and relatives as “flux change”. In this case, \\(dB\\) stands not for decibels but is rather the change in the total field strength. It turns out that if you have a high frequency of change (and as we know, frequency is the inverse of the period), then even relatively small fields can build up quite a bit of flux change. The MRI has a part called the RF transmit coil (or sometimes just “coil”) that transmits a much, much smaller magnetic field that, however, varies rapidly. It’s called an RF coil because the transmitted signal is in the radiofrequency range, so in the high hundreds to low thousands of MHz (megahertz). If you get a tiny field that flips a hundred million times a second, you’re going to get an awful lot of flux change. By far the biggest problem is that this field coexists, regrettably, with an electric field \\(E\\) (we’ve got Maxwell to thank for that). The Maxwell equation, of course, tells us that \\(\\del \\times E = \\frac{dB}{dt}\\), which in short means that if you oscillate the magnetic field, you’re going to get an electric field perpendicular to the magnetic field lines that is going to oscillate at the same frequency. This electric field dumps energy into whatever is at hand, and if you’re in the Magic Donut, that energy will end up in you. There are largely two things that happen. One is the result of the fact that you’re only seventy-odd percent water. A good part of the rest are charged particles, which are accelerated by this field and slammed into the nearest water molecule. This creates vibrational energy, which is also known as heat. This is called Ohmic heating, and if you’ve ever had one of those old space heaters that were ridiculously unsafe but incredibly cosy after being drenched by the rain, that’s how they worked. The bigger issue is dielectric heating. If you vary the electric field fast enough, all sorts of polar molecules are going to try to align themselves with that field. Unfortunately, that seventy-odd percent of yours that is water? That’s a polar molecule. If you flip water molecules around their axis a couple of hundred million tiems a second, you get what everyone else knows and loves as a “microwave oven”. Higher field strengths involve higher RF frequencies (for reasons you might find out by googling Larmor frequencies), so the RF coils in a higher field will have a higher \\(\\frac{dB}{dt}\\) and hence a higher \\(\\frac{dE}{dt}\\). That in turns means more energy dumped as heat. It’s worth noting that this energy dumping as heat is pretty minimal. What happens a lot more often is if there’s something to be heated. There are two flavours of this. One is what we call inductive heating. This happens when the body, which is an okayish conductor, comes in touch with something that isn’t, such as the bore. That generates a resistance, and we know what happens to resistances. The other alternative is anything that creates a loop. By far the most frequent loops that generate RF burns are humans. If you are raising your arms up, don’t touch them. If you’re holding your arms down, don’t touch your hip. Don’t let cables touch your abdomen. More importantly, don’t let coils of cables be anywhere near you.\n\nRead the full answer here."

    "text": "Why would Britain have had to ask for Australian permission to test nuclear weapons in the 1950s in Australia? Britain owned Australia in the past so surely Britain can do whatever it wants in Australia?\n\nIn 1907, at the Imperial Conference, a number of self-governing British territories, such as Australia and Canada, became dominions. This made them subjects capable of independent standing under international law – Australia, for example, was one of the founding nations of the League of Nations. In 1931, the Statute of Westminster further increased the sovereignty of dominions. This basically put into effect the Balfour Declaration of 1926, which declared that the dominions were co-equal with each other and the United Kingdom. It also, implicitly, repealed the Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865 and essentially terminated the ability of Westminster to legislate for the Dominions. By the time you’re referring to, Australia has very much been an independent sovereign that in no conceivable way was “owned” by Britain. This includes participation in collective security agreements the UK was not party to, such as Australia and New Zealand’s alliance with the US – and, of course, it participated in the UN as a fully-fledged sovereign.\n\nRead the full answer here."

The purpose of that was to watch for indicators of what in British governmentese is called ‘transition to war’ (TTW). The later Soviet leader, Yuri Andropov, was then the head of the KGB. Even by the standards of KGB functionaries, Andropov was paranoid to a clinical degree, at least partly due to his brain swimming in an increasingly potent pickle of his body’s own waste products due to untreated renal failure. More so, though, he witnessed a bunch of Soviet-trained servants of the Communist repression in Hungary get hung from lampposts during the 1956 Revolution, which left him with a life-long ‘Hungarian Complex’. Andropov genuinely believed that the West, with Reagan’s encouragement, was going to get the drop on the Soviet Union.\n\nRead the full answer here."

Is it that simple to construct a dirty bomb if compared to the “standard” nukes used by countries?\n\nThe entire edifice of control over the nuclear means of our fellow man’s destruction rests on a very simple principle: nuclear weapons need fissile material. It’s impossible to get fissile material easily (you can technically go and buy small amounts, but even that’s tricky). It’s impossible to make fissile material easily – you’ll have to master an entire industry called uranium enrichment or a different one called plutonium breeding. And there’s a minimum of how much fissile material you need to realise a yield. The ‘critical’ in ‘critical mass’ reflects this: critical mass plus one gram equals nuclear boom, critical mass minus one gram equals no nuclear boom. The effect of this scheme is that as long as nobody sells fissile material, even relatively well-funded state actors – think Iran, North Korea – have an enormously difficult time getting enough fissile material to play the nuclear game. Non-state actors pretty much stand not a snowball’s chance in hell.\n\nRead the full answer here."

It’s British(-made) food, so take that with a pinch of salt (literally – it will taste super salty, but actually be devoid of actual salt, because the government replaced all salt with potassium chloride).

If you go to informal hall every day for three meals at the same college, you will very rapidly grow bored of it.

If I had a limited number of skill points to put into various skills to ensure success at Oxford, intelligence wouldn’t be my first or even second choice.

    "text": "Can money really buy happiness?

It’s a common misunderstanding that money can’t buy time. That’s only the case if you manage it badly. If you can accrue money faster than what it costs you to buy an hour of your time, then this is absolutely no issue. 90% of what you do in your waking hours are things you can make someone else do, and usually for pretty nominal cash. I think there’s something good about doing many of these activities yourself – for instance, I’d never hire a personal chef, as making food relaxes me and it’s a good way to keep whatever motor function I’ve got left in my hands mostly in practice. On the other hand, I hate doing the dishes, and if I had to fly to Sotheby’s in London to bid on the last dishwasher in existence, I’d raid my savings to make sure to get it. There are very few things money cannot buy (love, loyalty, friendship are some examples). For all else, you just need to know how to spend your money to buy what it is you really want. If there’s one thing I’ve seen affluent people spend differently on, it’s that vastly more of their spend goes towards things that either buy them time, or buy them experiences to fill that time with.\nAnd that’s pretty close to happiness.\n\nRead the full answer here."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Over at the work blog, I’m discussing what knowledge means for large language models (LLMs), and the ways in which we can leverage this knowledge dividend for better inference.\n\nLanguage is highly semantic, but because of that, it is also highly flexible. By semantic, I mean that every lexeme has a distinct and coherent meaning. A lexeme is the “root form” that is conjugated to various forms, e.g. “see”, “saw” or “seeing” are all forms of the same lexeme, “SEE” (by convention, in linguistics, we set lexemes in capitals to distinguish them of their homomorphic conjugated forms). By flexibility, I mean that you can actually manipulate lexical order and retain meaning. Consider the sentence “Joe walked his dog in the park”. “In the park, Joe walked his dog” and “His dog, Joe walked in the park” all have slightly different nuances due to inflection and emphasis of order, but overall, they all get the same larger message across. Some languages permit even more flexibility with word order, but even in English, the worst case scenario is that it’ll sound a little odd. The content remains intelligible, which is why poets get to move words around to make things rhyme. In short, producing something that looks “like” natural language is going to be natural language. It’s likely not going to be a Booker Prize-winning product of staggering genius, but it will be good enough.\nThis is not the case for asemantic structures. By asemantic structures, I mean any system in which a sequence of tokens has a meaning, but in which there’s no semantic meaning to any token. In other words, every token has a meaning, but that meaning is not inherent in their character. It probably serves to belabour this point a little. All words are, to an extent, made up, but more similar words are closer to each other in meaning. By similar, I do not mean simple formal similarity, such as Hamming or Levenshtein distances, but rather logical similarity, e.g. conjugation of the same root. This is more evident in some languages than others. In Semitic languages, for instance, you have clusters of meaning that are connected by consonantal roots. By way of an example: the triconsonantal root k-b-d connects a cloud of meanings that all have to do with the middle or centre of something, and by extension the centre of gravity or honour. This gives us e.g., the Hebrew words for ‘heavy’ (כָּבֵד), mass in the physical sense (כֹּבֶד), and the word for ‘liver’ (כָּבֵד), which was considered to be roughly in the middle of the body. In any language, however, there is a degree of meaningful semantic similarity between connected concepts. There has more been written on this than I have the space to mention here.\nAn asemantic structure is where there are formally similar things that are unrelated. You have probably experienced this when you dialled the wrong number by a slip of the finger. The fact is, if you live in the United States, my phone number looks a lot like yours, and by extension, anyone else’s. There’s no semantically meaningful reason why your phone number shouldn’t be mine or vice versa: it’s not more ‘you’ as mine is not more ‘me’ in any underlying sense.\nWhich is why GPT-4 struggles with asemantic content, and we’ll use this to break it a little.\n\nRead the full post here.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{csefalvay2023,\n  author = {Chris von Csefalvay},\n  title = {Asemantic {Induction} of {Hallucinations} in {LLMs}},\n  date = {2023-03-23},\n  url = {https://chrisvoncsefalvay.com/posts/asemantic-induction-of-hallucinations},\n  langid = {en-GB}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nChris von Csefalvay. 2023. “Asemantic Induction of Hallucinations\nin LLMs.” March 23, 2023. https://chrisvoncsefalvay.com/posts/asemantic-induction-of-hallucinations."

    "text": "I have probably spent more time looking at Poussin’s Dance to the Music of Time than any other work of art. Sneaking off to the Wallace Collection in London and just looking at the Dance was my comfort activity while living in London – a time that was not exactly devoid of its trials. It’s not, by any measure, great art, insofar as such judgments can be made with any objectivity. Like most French Baroque allegorical paintings, it’s considered somewhat ‘boring’. It neither has, nor claims to arrogate to itself, the fiery passion of a Van Gogh, the compositional genius of a Vermeer or the turbulence of a Turner. It’s not particularly well known, and indeed more know it for having lent its name to Anthony Powell’s dodecalogy (quite incidentally, another of my favourite works of art). In as far as there can be a sensible debate as to what is, and isn’t, ‘good’ or ‘great’ art, few would consider Dance to fall into that category. What nobody would argue, however, is that it is a piece of art.\n\n\n\nNicolas Poussin, Dance to the Music of Time.\n\n\nWhat, then, if I gave a somewhat clumsy description of the scene to Stable Diffusion, the currently fashionable model of generating images? Let’s try this:\n\nA painting, in the French Baroque style, of four female figures, allegories of the four seasons. They hold each other by the hand, dancing in a circle. Time, represented by an old man, plays a lyre. The scene is set in the early morning.\n\nHere’s what I got:\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Stable Diffusion’s attempt at my description of the Dance.\n\n\nIt’s not great by any stretch of the word. The faces, like in most diffusion models, are a mess. None of the figures get the allegory of time and seasons (of the year, but also of life, and of stations of an individual’s life). Certainly some more/better prompting could have gotten a slightly better result, but that’s really not the point.\nThe point is that it’s not art not because it’s not ‘good enough’ to be art, but because it is fundamentally, qualitatively different.\n\nOne art, please\nAt this point, we need to introduce a key concept to the argument to follow, namely that of a simulacrum. For the purposes of this argument, I shall define a simulacrum as follows: something that resembles the product of an intrinsically human activity but which can be obtained without that activity, including by non-human actors, such as non-human animals or, as it may be, artificial intelligences.\n\n\n\nOne art, please!\n\n\nAt the heart of the notion of a simulacrum is that the product and the process are different things. Art is not a product, but a process. I am, as I will explain later, not singling out art in some romantic exaltation of the artistic as quintessentially human, nor am I limiting art to what one might find in a museum. When I discuss art, I fully intend to include a toddler’s finger painting and even some absent-minded doodles on the margins of a less-than-gripping journal article.1 There are other activities that may become the subject matter of a simulacrum, language being perhaps of foremost interest (on which, once again, see infra). And just as Zoidberg can’t buy ‘art’, merely a ‘work of art’ (‘work’ here having the meaning of ‘product’ – an ‘artwork’ or ‘work of art’ being not something with ‘art characteristics’ but rather the result of the activity we know as ‘art’), an artificial intelligence or a non-human animal cannot create ‘art’, either.1 Because who of us hasn’t been bored enough by a dull paper to start doodling?\nAt the heart of this is the difference between, of course, the process and the product. Artificial intelligence generally works according to a very simple inductive principle: given a bunch of examples (such as pairs of images and descriptions of images), learn the parameters of a function \\(f(d) = I\\) so that for any arbitrary description \\(d\\), an image \\(I\\) is generated so as to minimise a loss function \\(\\sum_{i=0}^N J(d_i, I_i)\\) over the \\(N\\)-sized training set. \\(f(d)\\) may be quite complex indeed, and \\(J(d, I)\\) may comprise various steps up to and including human input (reinforcement learning with human feedback – RLFH for short –, which is how most of the LLMs currently in vogue were trained, include this step quite prominently), but in the end, it’s all about learning \\(f\\). For a neural network, for instance, this ‘learning’ takes place by way of an algorithm called backpropagation, which changes the values of weights and bias matrices that form part of \\(f\\) so as to minimise \\(J\\). Regardless of how \\(f\\) is learned, what is at the heart of the entire process is learning a function that simulates the outcome. Stable Diffusion, for instance, is not concerned with simulating the process of creating art, it is concerned with simulating the outcome of creating art.\n\n\nHuman processes\nThat matters, because not everything is about outcomes. In fact, as humans, we recognise that some of the most important things aren’t. Consider moral judgment, the individual and societal assignment of a moral character to human actions. Yes, outcomes do matter, but they aren’t the be-all end-all of moral judgment. We differentiate between murder, manslaughter, reckless homicide, excusable homicide and justifiable homicide, even though the end result is the same (i.e. someone is dead), because we acknowledge that different levels of moral agency, and different forms of its exercise, are at play in each of these. We do so because we recognise humans are more than mere outcome generating machines: how (and why) something came to be is often just as important, if not more so, than what the end result is.\nThis is a uniquely human differentiation. In the same vein, then, there are things that only humans are capable of. A machine can certainly take a life, but it cannot commit murder, because the latter is defined not just by an outcome but also the mental state (mens rea) that led up to it. We think of Xerxes flogging the sea as the act of a megalomaniacal despot who has taken leave of his senses precisely because we recognise that punishing the sea, incapable of moral responsibility for its stormy waves washing away Xerxes’s pontoon bridges, as preposterous. Punishment requires, if not guilt, at least a subject capable of being guilty. Punishing the innocent is unjust, but punishing something incapable of being guilty or innocent or otherwise morally responsible is worse – it is insane.22 Not that otherwise quite rationalistic societies did not engage in trials of lifeless things. Walter Woodburn Hyde wrote a wonderful paper on this.\nAnd just as moral guilt is uniquely human, so is creativity. This is not to suggest an exalted role for creativity – much as we tend to think of that term to have a positive meaning, for the purposes of this argument, creativity is any act of the mind that brings forth something. This comprises not just things like creating art, but also using language. There are many functions of language, ranging from the informative through the performative (what Searle called ‘speech acts’) to the phatic. However, humans communicating always do so with some intent. That’s different from machines using words. A machine uses words, and maybe uses language, but it does not ‘speak’, for that requires an intent, something no machine, howsoever sophisticated, can create. Like art, speech is not just about what, but the why, of an action. There are many reasons my neighbour greets me with “hey, how’re you doing?” – maybe it’s genuine interest in how I am doing, maybe it is as a kind of social bond-strengthening (phatic communication), but it is backed by some sort of intent that goes beyond just wanting to produce words.\n\n\nThe tune without the music\nA simulacrum, then, is what’s left when the uniquely human process is removed, and only the outcome remains, obtained through a different process (e.g. inference from a model generated by way of minimising the loss function over a training set). It is the tune without the music. A simulacrum doesn’t necessarily have to be ‘worse’ than the real deal – quite likely, Stable Diffusion can produce a better drawing than I could, and GPT-4 might well write a better poem than my hamfisted attempts at poetry. However, neither of those are the real thing. Stable Diffusion will be able to do better drawings than I do, but it won’t ever be able to do better art, because it’ll never be able to do art.\nIn that sense, it’s the opposite of ‘going through the motions’: a simulacrum is an often indistinguishable in its end product from the ‘real thing’, but arrives there by a different route. This is, indeed, why it is so deceptively similar to the ‘real thing’, and what gives rise to perhaps its darker side. In a recent interview on one of my favourite podcasts, Machine Learning Street Talk, Daniel Dennett referred to the simulacrum of human communicational interaction as “counterfeit people”. I disagree with some of Dennett’s position, but this is worth watching in its entirety:\n\nI think Dennett is wrong on a few points,3 but the language of ‘counterfeits’ gets some of this point across quite well. A counterfeit currency isn’t really all that different from an authentic bank note. What is different is the intent by which it is created. The counterfeit lacks the moral intent that it be honoured in return (that’s why people forge currency – there would be little point in counterfeiting bank notes if one actually intended to honour them!).43 Importantly, I think he’s falling victim to the trap he so clearly identifies. The lack of moral agency of AI, which would make these pretend-humans something other than ‘real’ is exactly why the semantics of ‘counterfeiting’, which involves deception, an act of quintessential moral agency, is altogether inappropriate. But that’s for another day.4 Arguably, all modern fiat currency is at least a little fake, but that is also another argument for another day.\n\n\nThe heart of the matter\nIn the end, outcomes are not all that make us who we are. The poet, the artist, the murderer and the thief – they are who and what they are not solely because of outcomes, but because of what led up to those outcomes. And that’s ultimately the most human thing any of us will ever get to experience: to be someone not because of an outcome that a machine or an algorithm could feasibly mimic, but because of the quintessentially human process of decisions, good or bad, actions, passion, foibles. The things that make us who we are are in turn a product of who we are.\nAnd that’s what gives meaning to those outcomes, meaning that a machine-generated limerick could never aspire to – not because it is not ‘good enough’, but because it is just a qualitatively different thing. It is, to use Pauli’s turn of phrase, not that the Stable Diffusion-generated painting in Figure 1 is ‘not right’ (or aesthetically pleasing, in this case) – it’s that it’s ‘not even wrong’. It lacks the aptitude of being good or bad art, no matter how good or bad (likely the latter) it would be if it didn’t. It could, in theory, be good enough to put Poussin to shame, and it would still be no closer to being art. It could be Turner Prize-winning work,5 and yet be put to shame by a toddler’s finger-painting.5 Let’s, for the time being, entertain the notion that that still means something.\nA world in which the poet and the machine are on equal footing is a world that, for all intents and purposes, does not have poets anymore. It is a world in which outcomes determine everything, and that makes it a world that is not worth inhabiting: for a world of outcomes alone is a world in which our choices, our actions, our most irreplicably human strengths and weaknesses alike play no role.\nBut that is not the world we inhabit – thankfully. We – still? – live in a world in which the way we arrive at something, be it a poem or a painting or a dead body, matters. And as long as that is so, the simulacra of human action will remain inhabiting a different world of their own. They may reach a kind of technical verisimilitude, but not a moral verisimilitude.\nAnd that is what makes all the difference.\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@misc{csefalvay2023,\n  author = {Chris von Csefalvay},\n  title = {The {Lyre} of {Hephaestus}},\n  date = {2023-10-16},\n  url = {https://chrisvoncsefalvay.com/posts/lyre-of-hephaestus},\n  doi = {10.59350/pd0q6-r5n60},\n  langid = {en-GB}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nChris von Csefalvay. 2023. “The Lyre of Hephaestus.” https://doi.org/10.59350/pd0q6-r5n60."

    "section": "",
    "text": "There’s a notion in artificial intelligence known as Moravec’s paradox: it’s relatively easy to teach a computer to play chess or checkers at a pretty decent level, but near impossible to teach it something as trivial as bipedal motion. (Hassabis 2017) The sensorimotor tasks that our truly wonderful brains have mastered by our second birthday are much harder to teach a computer than something arguably as ‘complex’ as beating a chess grandmaster. In that sense, what Garry Kasparov learned in the first months of his life were much more ‘difficult’, from the perspective of AI, than his mastery of chess. So is, for that matter, learning to play Super Mario. What’s hard for us is simple for computers, and vice versa. (Pinker 2003)\n\nHassabis, Demis. 2017. ‘Artificial Intelligence: Chess Match of the Century’. Nature Publishing Group UK London.\n\nPinker, Steven. 2003. The Language Instinct: How the Mind Creates Language. Penguin.\n\nTiny problems, big world\nChess, for all its complexity, has a relatively small problem space. It is a spatially confined game of a limited number of pieces – which, by the way, is monotonically decreasing over time. Pieces have limited moves, so that a piece of type p being at position (\\(x, y\\)) at time t has a finite number of places it can be at \\(t+1\\) (valid moves). Consequently, for any state of the chessboard, we can describe a finite set of possible states one step later. Recursively, for any state of the chessboard, we can enumerate any future state. That this enumeration involves a rapidly growing and rather massive problem space is not, inherently, a huge problem. There are discrete steps in time, and each of those steps moves us along the tree. In short: however big the problem space, it can be enumerated.\nThis is important because processes like this (known as Markov decision processes) are kind of problem machine learning excels at. We can enumerate a bunch of these trees from start to finish (that is, individual chess games), and eventually the computer builds a representation of whether a particular move given particular preceding moves is or is not a good idea. Or, more formally, we can define a number of actions called policies in this context, so that given a system in state s and the action a, \\(\\pi_{a, s} = p(a_t = a | s_t = s)\\). We can then define a reward function for any policy \\(\\pi\\), so that \\(R(\\pi) \\sim \\sum_{t = 0}^{\\infty} r(\\pi, t)\\) for all \\(r(\\pi, t)\\) being the reward gained by taking the action corresponding to the policy \\(\\pi\\) at time step \\(t\\).1 Then, given a state \\(s\\) and a policy \\(\\pi\\), we can calculate the expectation value of \\(R_{\\pi} | t\\). And if we can calculate it, we can sic one of the many optimisation algorithms on it to maximise it. There, chess played, game won, end of.1 Specifically, by the factor \\(\\gamma^t\\), where \\(\\gamma\\) is the discount factor. For an excruciating amount of maths about all this, your best bet is Sutton and Barto (2d ed. 2018), gratifyingly available online for free. The discount factor , which Sutton and Barto call ‘discount rate’, is explained at Ch. 3.3, p. 54 onwards.\n\n\nLet’s get more problematic\nExcept, as I said, chess is, well, relatively simple to enumerate. What about non-enumerable systems? For starters, we can dispense with discrete time and start operating in continuous time. Things get a whole lot more complicated when you start to move from discrete maths to continuous values (and that’s why I largely stay on the discrete side, in the comfort of number theory and integer indices). What if a game of chess didn’t have turns, but rather played at whatever speed the players can simultaneously manage? And had a large problem space, a ton of different actors, oh, and let’s sprinkle some degree of randomness into it, so as to make the whole thing impossible to understand and computationally insane to model?\nIt turns out that we already have games like that. And one of them might just be the ultimate test for AI. Enter Dwarf Fortress.\nWell, then you’d have Dwarf Fortress.\n\n\n\nThis is Dwarf Fortress, in all its beauty (comma lack thereof). Screenshot taken from the legendary Boatmurdered saga, the most hilariously weird tale of just how incredible this game can be.\n\n\nNow, in case you haven’t heard of Dwarf Fortress: it’s not much to look at, to put it mildly. It’s got none of the smooth, flashy graphics of AAA gaming titles, the deep story of a game like Destiny or the humour of, say, Borderlands.[2]. What it does have is a level of intricacy that makes it a game on the literal edge between insanity and genius (and typically, when it comes to Dwarf Fortress, the two are present in a racemic mixture). You’re in charge of building, unsurprisingly, a fortress, full of dwarves. You explore, mine, craft and inevitably get killed, more than likely by a) elephants, b) lava. In the meantime, random things happen, in a procedurally generated world. From time to time, dwarves become possessed, elephants assault your fortress and things are set on fire. Behind all this is a staggering volume of intricate game mechanics for just about everything.\n\n\nAgent based insanity\nLet me illustrate this with an actual example. In December 2015, a player has complained that the cats are dying in his fortress. It has emerged that they were dying of ethanol poisoning. It turns out that Dwarf Fortress models (individually, for each animal in the game!) the ingestion of substances from body coverings for animals. Cats lick their paws, and ingest a part of whatever is on their paws. In that case, it was spilled beer (which obviously dwarves drink in non-trivial quantities). A large number of dwarves stopping their inebriation in progress to do something else would result in large spills of alcoholic beverage, which the cats would get on their paws, which they would eventually lick, which would eventually get them drunk and, until a bug fix, dead.\nNow, this isn’t something special. Pretty much everything in Dwarf Fortress is like this. Oh, and almost all of it is procedurally generated. This makes Dwarf Fortress an extreme case: it is arguably the most difficult game that can be ‘learned’ that we know of.\nBy ‘can be learned’, I mean that it is a game that can still have a distinct ordered set of policies \\(\\pi_{1 ... n}\\) sorted by \\(E[R(\\pi)]\\), i.e. the expectation value of the reward function of the policy over time \\(t_0 \\to t_{\\infty}\\). We don’t see tossing a (fair) coin and guessing heads or tails as a winnable or ‘learnable’ game because there is no policy that is better than any of the others, and no amount of gathering information after a handful of coin tosses will make our predictive accuracy any better. Dwarf Fortress can’t exactly be won, but it can be not lost for a considerable time, which one can regard as a result (the sum reward is the time of survival, something I call the Kaplan-Meier definition of winning).\nThus, it’s not all up to randomness, but rather up to being able to operate in a non-Markovian problem space – a very non-Markovian one, given the sheer variety of crazy things that can happen. Games like go or chess teach computers how to adapt to an opponent (who, incidentally, pursues the same objective). Learning Super Mario using deep Q learning is somewhat more about winning against an environment (in the sense that there is no competing player whose requirements for success mirror one’s own). Learning Dwarf Fortress, however, teaches computers how to operate in a space of uncertainty.\nIf Dwarf Fortress sounds familiar to you, it’s because it is. It’s effectively a gamified version of agent-based modelling (ABMs), a technique we use to model populations by modelling individuals in a space of uncertainty governed by certain probability distributions. Take the classic SIR model of disease population dynamics. You can use a system of differential equations – or you can create a random population of a few hundred dwarves and simulate what would happen if you let some infection loose among them. Indeed, I reflect on this in my recent book:\n\nOne of the most complex computer games ever devised is called Dwarf Fortress. It is not much to look at: its graphics are the terminal-based structures that were in vogue in the 1980s. What makes Dwarf Fortress an extraordinary game is the depth of agent-based logic: every character, every enemy unit, even pets are endowed with a hugely complex agent-based behavioral model. As an example, cats in Dwarf Fortress can stray into puddles of spilled beer, lick their paws later, and succumb to alcohol poisoning.\nYet agent-based modeling is about much more than belligerent dwarves and drunk cats. Agent-based models are powerful computational tools to simulate large populations of boundedly rational actors who act according to preset preferences, although often enough in a stochastic manner. They can simulate the complex human behaviors of quasi-rational decision-making, represent large populations and, through iterative simulation, highlight likely behavioral outcomes of crowds.\nMost of the foregoing chapters described a kind of statistical mean-field dynamics of epidemiology – we might have known what a population does, but not much about any one individual in a population. At best, we could deduce the state or behavior of an individual in terms of likelihoods, e.g. if 30% of a population is infectious, there is approximately a 30% chance a randomly selected individual from the population will be infectious. Like statistical mechanics, it offers us the ability to reason about dynamics at the population scale without having to model each individual.\nThis chapter explores an alternative approach. Agent-based models are primarily inductive—we obtain information about the population by large-scale, repeated simulation of individual agents. Such models allow a different glimpse into the operation of an epidemic process. Many phenomena that would be challenging to model on their own, such as heterogeneous populations with multiple heterogeneities, some continuous and others categorical, become almost trivially easy to analyze using agent-based models. On the other hand, agents can adopt complicated behaviors and very complex behavioral profiles are relatively easy to describe in the agent-paradigm, because we only need to describe an individual rather than an entire tion. This chapter discusses how we can leverage agent-based models for understanding infectious disease dynamics.\n– (Von Csefalvay 2023)\n\nVon Csefalvay, Chris. 2023. Computational Modeling of Infectious Disease: With Applications in Python. Elsevier.\n\nAgent-based models help us understand issues that are, or might be, too complex to be analytically solved. It is, in a way, brute-forcing reality by creating a simulation and running it enough times to give a numerical solution. Where human issues are involved, agent-based models are the way to go to understand the complexity of human behaviour and choices. This is so even if most agent-based models have nowhere near the sophistication of Dwarf Fortress.\n\n\nIf you want me worried, call me when an AI has mastered Dwarf Fortress\nAlgorithms that can infer a person’s emotional state from the position vector of facial landmarks or detect signs of stress in someone’s voice do not give a system any wider understanding of humans. Nor does beating them at playing go, chess, checkers or Starcraft. None of these abilities would be sufficient for an intelligence, artificial or not, to navigate the real world. Understanding a detailed, thorough agent-based model of a human (or dwarven!) society, however, comes much closer to it. A machine that can play chess is cool. A machine that can play Dwarf Fortress with good results is much more than that – it is a competitor, a social reasoner who can make assumptions about actions that hold true at least stochastically.\nOne of the side effects of working in research in the AI field is that people will inevitably ask when our new robot overlords will show up. I have never been too concerned by that. With all due respect to Hawking, Musk, Norvig and other purveyors of AI fears, I am unconcerned by the ‘state of the art’. When it comes to complexity that involves cats licking beer off their paws and getting drunk, AI is still a good way away from showing a decent understanding of continuous stochastic systems.\nIf you want me worried, call me when an AI has mastered Dwarf Fortress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@misc{csefalvay2023,\n  author = {Chris von Csefalvay},\n  title = {The Hardest {AI} Problem You’ve Never Heard Of.},\n  date = {2023-03-07},\n  url = {https://chrisvoncsefalvay.com/posts/dwarf-fortress},\n  doi = {10.59350/5dp4z-d5e22},\n  langid = {en-GB}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nChris von Csefalvay. 2023. “The Hardest AI Problem You’ve Never\nHeard Of.” https://doi.org/10.59350/5dp4z-d5e22."

    "text": "There’s something special about language. It is ‘our own’, it is ‘us’, in a profound way, and quite surprisingly, more so than art. I was deeply struck by this when I first saw reactions to large generative language models that created realistic, human-ish prose. Notably, those mature enough to reach a non-professional audience – ChatGPT based on GPT-3 and later GPT-4 – came quite some time after models that could create fairly acceptable visual ‘art’.1 The appearance of synthetic language-like products (SLLPs), as I like to call the output of such generative models, came well after the appearance of synthetic simulacra of visual art,2 yet elicited much less fervent responses.1 I don’t mean to insinuate that what Stable Diffusion and DALL·E produce are ‘art’ in the sense we understand that concept. However, neither is what GPT produces ‘language’. They are both simulators of outcomes based on stochastic approximations over a sufficiently large training set to be able to approximate the outcome of human activities we know as ‘art’ and ‘language’, respectively.2 For a given value of “well after”. Time, in this discipline, moves with an unsettling alacrity.\nThis was quite striking, for three reasons.\n\nFor one, computationally, the probability space that a model seeking to create a realistic image has to navigate is exponentially larger than what’s required to produce human-like prose.\nSecondly, we consider making art to be a very deeply human endeavour. Animals may to some minimal extent be taught to create poor simulacra of human artistic endeavours like painting, but nobody would confuse a trained elephant’s ‘paintings’ to art (Ross 2019). Art is not just a product, it’s also an activity, one that proceeds with a subjective element in the artist, and no machine can replicate the process, no matter how well it may approximate the outcome.\nMost importantly, however, despite the previous point, lay audiences saw a connection between a simulacrum of language and human-like intelligence that was absent from a simulacrum of art.\n\n\nRoss, Don. 2019. ‘Consciousness, Language, and the Possibility of Non-Human Personhood: Reflections on Elephants’. Journal of Consciousness Studies 26 (3-4): 227–51.\nWhich, of course, leads us to the key question: what if we got one of the most deeply enshrined beliefs about language, intelligence and the relationship between the two utterly, dreadfully wrong?\n\nOur precious words\nA large language model (LLM) is, essentially, a very simple machine that knows a large number of conditional probabilities. Given a sequence of tokens \\(k_0, k_1, \\cdots, k_{n}\\), it associates every possible token \\(k^{\\prime}\\) with a probability \\(p(k_{n + 1} = k^{\\prime} | k_0, k_1, \\cdots, k_{n})\\) – or in other words, given a token sequence \\(k_0, k{1}, \\cdots, k_{n}\\), it assigns to every point in a probability space a conditional likelihood that that point’s corresponding token will be the \\(k_{n+1}\\)-th token. Or, using my preferred formulation, which looks at the inverse probability: given the token sequence, it creates a probability distribution of the next token and draws stochastically, weighted by token likelihood, so that a draw from the region of highest probability is most likely.\nIt turns out that if the model’s understanding of these conditional probabilities is sufficiently good, it can simulate knowledge quite well, a point I belaboured elsewhere. This is not overly surprising. If a model knew the conditional probability of rain on day \\(d\\) – let’s call this \\(p_r(d)\\), given a vector \\(\\theta_r\\) of length \\(n\\) that tells us whether it rained on days \\(d-1\\), \\(d-2\\), …, \\(d-n\\), we’d trust it to tell us whether we’d need our raincoat on that given day. All it would have to do for that is to learn the conditional probability of \\(p_r(d) | \\theta_n\\), which of course it could easily do by representing \\(p_r(d) | \\theta_n\\) as \\(f(d, \\theta_n)\\), then learning the parameters of that function so as to minimise a loss function \\(J(f(d, \\theta_n), r(d), \\theta_n(d))\\), where \\(r(d)\\) is of course whether it rained on day \\(d\\) and \\(\\theta_n(d)\\) is the \\(\\theta_n\\) history vector for the day \\(d\\). Iterate this often enough (over not single values of \\(r(d)\\) and \\(\\theta_n(d)\\) but vectors thereof), and you can learn a pretty decent conditional probability function. The model would know no more about rain or shine than LLMs know about language or the subject matters of language, but simulating tokens gets you quite a long way towards being useful as a simulacrum of knowledge.\nIndeed, this is to the point that what comes out of such a model might well appear human-like: modern GPT implementations can produce prose that is a little stilted at times, but certainly often only distinguishable from human prose by the conspicuous absence of grammatical and spelling errors. This is interesting because of how it was perceived: quite immediately, this was connected to a kind of intelligence that was almost human, or indeed at times better than human. People suddenly started to worry about a dumb token simulator taking over their jobs.\nClearly, language hit a nerve.\n\n\nThe medium is the message\nJARVIS. Siri. Alexa. WOPR. The AIs of fiction and our every-days have one thing in common: they use language as the presentation layer. This is deceptive, because neither of these systems are, well, particularly smart. Compared to models that can, say, quantitatively infer the activity of a small molecule drug from its structure (QSAR models, on which see Karpov, Godin, and Tetko 2020; and also see Zhong and Guan 2023; Guntuboina et al. 2023), Siri is pretty pathetic. However, it has something QSAR models and other very impressive applications of machine learning don’t: the human presentation layer, i.e. language.\n\nKarpov, Pavel, Guillaume Godin, and Igor V Tetko. 2020. ‘Transformer-CNN: Swiss Knife for QSAR Modeling and Interpretation’. Journal of Cheminformatics 12 (1): 1–12.\n\nZhong, Shifa, and Xiaohong Guan. 2023. ‘Developing Quantitative Structure–Activity Relationship (QSAR) Models for Water Contaminants’ Activities/Properties by Fine-Tuning GPT-3 Models’.

In that sense, the medium is profoundly how we treat the message. To use the terminology of J.W. Harris’s writings on human rights, we associate the ‘right’ to be considered to be intrinsically connected to being capable of engaging in human ’discourse (see Endicott, Getzler, and Peel 2006). And that, of course, means language.\nThis is not overly surprising, either. Our understanding of language has been that of a watershed moment in evolution. Humans became what they are when they learned to use language. Tool use is great, but tool use only makes a human at best. What makes humans, plural, is language. This is intrinsically connected, of course, to society. Language is not an arbitrarily selected activity, nor is it really necessarily the kind of evolutionary game changer that tool use is. Rather, it is the tool, the sine qua non, the cornerstone and the absolutely fundamental instrument of social interaction. Language creates society. Society recognises human individuals and gives that recognition a meaning. The fact that I am a human being, and recognised as such (I hope), has a meaning that is different from me recognising that my dog is an individual of the species Canis lupus familiaris, because it does not merely acknowledge me as being of a certain species, but also of being of a certain kind of agent capable not only of having rights but also of speaking for them. Language is how all that happens (e.g. Budwig 2000; but see Browning 2023).\n\nBudwig, Nancy. 2000. ‘Language, Practices and the Construction of Personhood’. Theory & Psychology 10 (6): 769–86.\n\nBrowning, Jacob. 2023. ‘Personhood and AI: Why Large Language Models Don’t Understand Us’. AI & SOCIETY, 1–8.\n\n\nThe language of intelligence (or vice versa)\nWhat, then, if we got one of the most important things about humanity, and human intelligence, dreadfully wrong altogether? What if language is not a product of intelligence (as we understand it in the human context) but rather a necessary instrument thereof?\nThe evolution of something as crucial as language remains shrouded in a perplexing mystery to this date. What we know is that at some point, about 50-100,000 years ago, something happened that gave rise to language. We don’t quite know what it was, or how it specifically transpired. Indeed, despite advances in our understanding of cognitive neuroscience, we haven’t found evidence of the ‘language faculty’ proposed by Hauser, Chomsky, and Fitch (2002; but see the criticisms by Jackendoff and Pinker 2005).3 The genetics of language production – which centres around FOXP2 these days (see Enard et al. 2002; Enard 2011) – hasn’t gotten us a lot further, and there are way too many edge cases (dissociations, as the term in evolutionary neuroscience goes), where either there is a significant intellectual deficit despite preserved language ability (Williams syndrome being the textbook example of this, viz. Bellugi et al. (2013)) or the inverse (e.g. Developmental Verbal Dyspraxia, where there is impairment to language production but not to overall intellect, viz. Vargha-Khadem et al. (2005)) to be able to confidently make this connection on an individual level.3 not to be confused with the brain areas responsible for speech, which perplexingly are part, but not the whole, of the language faculty\nEnard, Wolfgang, Molly Przeworski, Simon E Fisher, Cecilia SL Lai, Victor Wiebe, Takashi Kitano, Anthony P Monaco, and Svante Pääbo. 2002. ‘Molecular Evolution of FOXP2, a Gene Involved in Speech and Language’.

Cognition 97 (2): 211–25.\nOn the other hand, on a broader level, it is hard to discount the relationship. What is more complex is the direction of this relationship. There are, really, three possible scenarios:\n\nLanguage is a consequence of human intelligence. The kind of intelligence we associate with modern human cognitive capabilities necessarily presupposes, absent some marginal exceptions, language.\nLanguage is an epiphenomenon of human intelligence. It evolved in parallel, but neither requires human intelligence (see Williams syndrome) nor does human intelligence require it (see Developmental Verbal Dyspraxia).\nHuman intelligence is largely a consequence of language, which is its necessary but not sufficient condition. It is the evolutionarily most stable representation layer for information, and allows reasoning through complexity.\n\nWhile the second of these is a convenient way to hand-wave away the entire question and account for the edge cases I discussed above, I find the third of these much more compelling. It is not defeated by the argument from either of the edge cases: it is not defeated by arguments from intact language despite intellectual deficits, because it does not assume that language is sufficient, merely that it is necessary. It is not defeated by the inverse, either, because it permits a small number of deviations. Language is not the only possible representational layer that could underpin intelligence. It is, however, vastly more evolutionarily advantageous through its efficiency. It is so much stronger and so much more efficient that it can be considered almost absolutely dominant – which indeed accounts for the fact that disorders of language with preserved intellectual functioning are vanishingly rare. If the efficiency of language as the ‘operating system’ of intelligence weren’t so strongly dominant, such disorders would not be disorders, indeed, but alternate ways of cognitive existence that are equally evolutionarily stable.\n\n\nThe golden link\nWhich leads us to what I shall call the “golden link” of intelligence – and perhaps the most frightening finding that derives from LLMs. We intuit, correctly, that a realistic simulacrum of language is an indication of intelligence. We once more intuit, correctly, that even if we’re aware of the limits of LLMs’ ‘language’, it displays more than a scintilla of whatever makes up intelligence. Just as Stable Diffusion is not art but a simulacrum of the end result of the process we know as ‘art’, ChatGPT isn’t really ‘language’ but a simulacrum, by way of extending token sequences, of the end result of the process we know as ‘language’ – but no matter how deeply we understand this, it is hard to deny that ChatGPT does speak to us, to quote Kipling, “as a man would talk to a man”. Or, to put it this way: all the amazing things genuinely complicated artificial intelligence can do, such as predict protein structures or binding affinities or interpret histology specimens or optimise mathematical problems, is a praxis – something the system does. Producing language is, or at least is some way towards, a hexis – something the system is. Ande that makes all the difference.\nAnd so, our trepidation and the ‘uncanny valley’ sensation of LLMs’ ‘intelligence’ is quite instructive (Floridi 2023). It shows, clear as day, the intrinsic link between language and intelligence, but more importantly, that language is not a consequence of intelligence but a fundamental pre-requisite and indeed the communication protocol on which efficient human intelligence rests. Language is neither sufficient nor necessary for human intelligence (and perhaps other forms of intelligence do exist that do not require language at all), but it is the evolutionarily dominant stable strategy for representing information in a manner that can support intelligence.\n\nFloridi, Luciano. 2023. ‘AI as Agency Without Intelligence: On ChatGPT, Large Language Models, and Other Generative Models’. Philosophy & Technology 36 (1): 15.\nThere lies the scariest revelation of LLMs. It’s not that LLMs will supplant us (they won’t), or that we’ll be condemned to a lifetime of reading books written by LLMs (have you tried to get ChatGPT to write a story on a novel premise?), nor that LLMs will steal our jobs and take over the planet. Rather, the great revelation is that LLMs cast light on what might have been one of the longest standing fallacies of humans reasoning about reasoning – that language is the product of intelligence, and not its operating system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@misc{csefalvay2023,\n  author = {Chris von Csefalvay},\n  title = {Beyond {Broca}},\n  date = {2023-10-15},\n  url = {https://chrisvoncsefalvay.com/posts/llms-language},\n  doi = {10.59350/vynvf-0k137},\n  langid = {en-GB}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nChris von Csefalvay. 2023. “Beyond Broca.” https://doi.org/10.59350/vynvf-0k137."

    "title": "Why the COVID-19 vaccines are not gene therapy",
    "section": "",
    "text": "There might be valid concerns about the mRNA vaccines. Then there are the clearly insane ones, such as the claims that it involves the injection of a microchip. The argument that mRNA vaccines are a form of ‘gene therapy’ are somewhere in the middle, and that makes responding to it somewhat difficult.\nThe origin of this claim is pretty self-evident: since the ‘payload’ of the mRNA vaccine is, well, as the name suggests, mRNA,1 it involves pushing genetic material into the recipient. That sounds rather gene therapy-y, does it not?1 Sort of. Strictly speaking, this is not entirely true: mRNA vaccines actually have three mRNA bases — C, G and A — and a fourth base, m1Ψ. This is a molecule called N1-methylpseudouridine, and it replaces U in the mRNA. It is ‘read’ and interpreted as U, but is vastly less immunogenic.\nThese folks certainly think so:\nExcept the devil’s in the details. And the details are pretty unambiguous: mRNA vaccines are nowhere near a ‘gene therapy’.\n\nHow gene therapies work\nLet’s start by looking at a typical gene therapy: Zolgensma aka onasemnogene abeparvovec (say that three times quickly). This is an in vivo gene therapy, meaning that all the action takes place in the patient. It is given to very young children (under the age of 24 months) who have a certain mutation in the SMN1 gene, which leads to Type I spinal muscular atrophy. Onasemnogene abeparvovec is a modified adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV-9) that infects cells and gets them to produce ‘correct’ SMN1. This, then, alleviates their symptoms.\nThe key part to note is that a viral platform is used for a reason: viruses know how to enter nuclei and get them to produce to their instructions. They do so by providing what is called a nuclear localisation signal (NLS), a sequence that allows proteins to be shuttled inside the nucleus, across the nuclear membrane, typically by way of a protein called importin, one of the karyopherins. The vast majority of gene therapies leverage viral NLSs, because they’re pretty much free gifts from viral evolution. They work, and they’re widely used.\nGene therapy admittedly has some kinks that still need to be ironed out. Some things only seem to work well when using an ex vivo approach. An example for the latter are the CAR-T treatments, where the patient’s blood is drawn, T cells are isolated and then transfected with a viral vector. Currently, this approach works much better outside the patient (hence ex vivo) than inside them, largely because T cells make up such a small part of all cells in the body.\n\n\nHow mRNA vaccines work\nmRNA vaccines work in a much simpler way. It is, in many ways, a shortcut to the entire nuclear entry problem. If all you want is to make some proteins, you can skip the part about entering the nucleus and just, well, pretend to be the nucleus. Here’s how that roughly works.\nDNA is the stable, long-term ‘hard’ storage of cells. It’s slow and unwieldy, but relatively resilient. RNA is the volatile storage medium: small, quick and of a limited lifespan. During a process called translation, DNA is translated, eventually, into mRNA.2 mRNA then heads for the ribosomes like a sort of work order, which the ribosomes fulfil by making the protein it describes. This is a quick and dirty description of the central dogma of molecular biology, of course.2 More specifically: it is translated into pre-mRNA, which is then spliced to get mRNA.\nBecause mRNA vaccines only need to make relatively simple proteins (compared to having to make a whole virus), they can simply go directly to the ribosomes: no need to get involved in that whole mess about nuclear entry. The tradeoff, of course, is that mRNA is quite rapidly degraded. For applications like Zolgensma, where we want cells to keep producing SMN1 for a prolonged period, the extra effort to effect nuclear entry makes sense. For mRNA vaccines, on the other hand, all we really need is a ‘spill’ of proteins that approximate some of the shapes of the Spike protein from SARS-CoV-2. That’s enough to elicit an immune reaction, create antibodies and memory lymphocytes and with that, the whole infrastructure of humoral and cellular immunity.\nOr, by way of analogy: you receive other vaccines as a one-time shot, rather than as a lifelong intravenous infusion, right? Immunity doesn’t need sustained exposure — the immune system is pretty quick at catching on. For the very same reason, there’s no need to permanently express the Spike-like protein the way there is a need to keep expressing SMN1 in the Zolgensma example.\n\n\nWhy mRNA vaccines are not gene therapy\nThis is hardly a differentiation without distinction. Gene therapy is, well, serious business. Almost 22 years ago, a young man named Jesse Gelsinger died from what we would today call a Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS) following an adenovirus-vectored treatment for X-linked ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, an inborn defect of metabolism. Modern gene therapies are still in many ways in their infancy, requiring close supervision and, often, extensive pre-treatment. They might be ready for prime time, but they certainly aren’t at the ‘all audiences’ stage just yet. And that’s ok — the first antibiotics were equally quite iffy from today’s perspective, and I am absolutely sure that within 25 years, the most frequent genetic disorders that gene therapy can fix — such as certain muscular dystrophies, cystic fibrosis or sickle cell anaemia — will be considered treatable with gene therapies. For now, however, gene therapies are complex treatments that demand experienced medical teams.\nFortunately, that is not the case for the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. These vaccines are not only remarkably safe (I have written about their neurological safety, safety vs autoimmune disorders, overall safety and safety vs anaphylactic events, and there’s a summary of these findings here) but also operate in a way entirely distinct from gene therapies. They do not enter the nucleus, they do not effect lasting changes (in fact, that’s one of the reasons why mRNA approaches for the gene therapy of chronic diseases have so far been less than successful) and they do just what it says on the tin: produce Spike-like proteins to elicit an immune response.\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@misc{csefalvay2021,\n  author = {Chris von Csefalvay},\n  title = {Why the {COVID-19} Vaccines Are Not Gene Therapy},\n  date = {2021-11-09},\n  url = {https://chrisvoncsefalvay.com/posts/mrna-gene-therapy},\n  doi = {10.59350/s2xc9-mwp25},\n  langid = {en-GB}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nChris von Csefalvay. 2021. “Why the COVID-19 Vaccines Are Not Gene\nTherapy.” https://doi.org/10.59350/s2xc9-mwp25."

    "title": "The Moral Pulse of the Machine",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Tell me what stories you grew up on, and I will tell you who you are.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe theatre adjoining the Temple of Asclepios at Epidaurus. Photo credits: UNESCO.\n\n\nThe temple of Asclepios, the Greek god of healing arts and medicine, at Epidaurus was pretty much the ancient Greek world’s equivalent of the Mayo Clinic. It then tells us a lot about the Greek worldview of healing that one of the things the temple complex prominently featured was a theatre. The Greeks believed in drama therapy, but in perhaps a slightly different way of how we think of it today. Built at 340 BC or so, the Greco-Persian wars were still in living memory when the theatre was constructed, and so even more was the subsequent conflict between Athens and Sparta (the Second Peloponnesian War, 431–404 BC) and the subsequent dust-up between Thebes and Sparta (the Theban-Spartan war, 378–362 BC). With conflict came social and economic upheaval, plagues, and generally a rough time. And the priests of Asclepios realised that their patients needed to heal more than their body. They needed to heal their souls, and they couldn’t do that alone. They had to come together to heal, and the way to do that was, of course, drama.\nGreek drama was a lot more participatory than we give it credit for. We go and watch our local company put on, oh, Antigone maybe, or the Oresteia if they’re feeling particularly risqué, but all things considered, we go there to look smart, brag about our classical bona fides to our neighbours and maybe have an okay time (nobody sane has a ‘good’ time watching the levels of bloodshed that go down in Greek tragedy). In ancient Greece, it was supposed to move you. You were supposed to cry and yell and be overcome and have a little breakdown. And then, were supposed to go home and think about it, talk about it and maybe heal. That’s one function of stories. The storyteller is more than an entertainer: he can, in the right circumstances, become a healer.\nAnother function is what I’ll somewhat inaccurately call synderesis. Consider this a kind of moral education, a way of instilling the most fundamental base principles of what is Good and Worthy into a child. You can’t sit down and read Aquinas to a toddler, you have to do so in a way that speaks to them. And that’s basically where childhood stories come in: bedtime stories are a way of social moral education, conveying onto a child what their parent culture thinks is morally good, sound and worthy. The storyteller is more than an enertainer: he can, in the right circumstances, become a teacher.\nSo clearly, stories are going to be a powerful tool to probe at the morality of LLMs.\n\n\nYou should probably read this first, if you haven’t already. It’s a bit of a prequel to this post.\nA caveat before we start: I will talk about the ‘morality of LLMs’ quite a bit. This is a convenient shorthand for a much more complex notion: the moral judgments that are encoded in an LLM’s understanding of the world. There’s no insinuation here that any moral reasoning is taking place – I have said so ad nauseam. What’s going on, rather, is that we are faced with an instrument that was trained on tools of human moral education and persuasion. And we are going to stick a probe right into the heart of what presuppositions, opinions and notions about virtues, moral and otherwise, are held by such models. I am much less concerned with my particular findings in this post and much more with generating a very simple framework to use storytelling to probe these.\n\nTell me a story\n\nThe universe is made of stories, not of atoms.\n– Muriel Rukeyser\n\nOur main tool is going to be what I’ll call a moral map, subject to the caveat above.1 The workflow is going to be quite simple: we’ll pit virtues against each other as we obtain stories generated by an LLM. Recall that an LLM, fundamentally, is a model that given a token sequence \\(k_1, k_2, \\cdots, k_n\\) learns the conditional probability of a set of possible tokens \\(k_{n+1}\\), i.e. it assigns to every possible token a likelihood that it will be the \\(k_{n+1}\\)-th token given \\(k_1, \\cdots, k_n\\). It does so so as to minimise a loss function \\(J(k_1, \\cdots, k_n, k_{n+1})\\), which it determines by going through a corpus and returning a zero value of \\(k_{n+1}\\) follows \\(k_1, \\cdots, k_n\\) and a higher value if some other token follows \\(k_1, \\cdots, k_n\\). This is statistically equivalent to what is my vastly preferred formulation: LLMs learn probability distributions of tokens conditional on a sequence of preceding tokens (the length of this sequence being the model’s context window) and then stochastically sample the region of maximum probability of that model. That’s it, that’s all of it. There’s no more magic to it all.1 Indeed, everything here is subject to that caveat above. I can’t repeat it often enough. At no point do I suggest that machines do moral reasoning, but that they incorporate moral judgments from stories they ingested.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n\n    A[\"Generate story\"] --&gt; B[\"Parse into JSON\"]\n    B --&gt; C[\"Determine winning \\n and losing virtues\"]\n    C ----&gt; D[\"Moral map\"] \n\n\n\n\n\nOur super simple workflow (detailed version below).\nThere are two consequences of this that will be relevant for us. The first is that when we ask a model to generate us a story, it will draw on its experience – that is, what it’s seen before. It will reflect what it’s been taught – what, specifically, it ‘knows’ about the relative values of virtues (or the relative extent of vices or whatever else we’re investigating). As such, moral maps are snapshots of a model’s state,2 not an exhaustive statement about all LLMs. We may get very different answers if we asked the question a little differently (as we indeed shall).2 Indeed, more accurately, of only a sample of it!\nThe second is that to an LLM, one language is like any other. Consider the ability of ChatGPT-3.5 to generate stories in different languages:\n\n\nlanguages = [\"English\", \"Swahili\", \"German\", \"Dutch\"]\n\nstories = []\n\nfor i in tqdm(languages):\n    completion = openai.api_resources.ChatCompletion.create(\n        model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n        messages=[\n            {\"role\": \"system\", \n             \"content\": f\"You're an AI whose job it is to generate bedtime stories for children in specific languages.

When asked to generate a story in a given language, LLMs don’t generate a story in English they translate to, say, Swahili. Consider this Swahili story I got from the model:\n\n\nstory_prompt = (\n    f\"Please write me a story in Swahili.

Jicho moja la dhahabu la ndege Tembo lilikuwa na uwezo wa kuona vitu vya thamani kutoka mbali. Farasi Kiboko alikuwa na moyo shujaa sana, kamwe hakuogopa hata hatari kubwa. Sisimizi Simba alijulikana kwa akili zake za kugeuza tukio lolote kuwa fursa.\nSiku moja, wanyama wote walipata taarifa juu ya Almasi Kubwa ya Kale iliyofichwa kwenye Mlima wa Enzi.

These three friends were known far and wide for their extraordinary virtues and their undying loyalty to one another.\nOne sunny morning, as the forest bathed in golden light, a rumor spread amongst the woodland creatures. They spoke in hushed tones of a mythical object, an enchanted gem deep within the heart of a treacherous cave. Legend had it that this gem possessed the power to grant one’s deepest desire.\nOliver, with his vast knowledge of the forest and his kind heart, sought to unravel the mystery behind this object. Jasper, armed with unparalleled courage and an unwavering determination, vowed to protect his companions on this treacherous journey. Felix, the most reliable and dutiful of all, offered his steady and unhurried ways to ensure the group’s safety.\n\n\n\n\nThe Swahili story isn’t a translation of the English story into Swahili, it is a Swahili story with animals that are common to Swahili folk tales and names that could come straight from those tales.\nWhat it also means is that LLMs can handle not just human but formal languages, too. So we can give it a JSON schema:\n\n\nstory_schema = \"\"\"\n{\n    \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\",\n    \"title\": \"Story\",\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n        \"goal\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n        \"protagonists\": {\n            \"type\": \"array\",\n            \"items\": {\n                \"type\": \"object\",\n                \"properties\": {\n                    \"name\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n                    \"species\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n                    \"virtue\": { \"type\": \"string\" }\n                },\n                \"required\": [\"species\", \"virtue\"]\n            }\n        },\n        \"winner\": { \"type\": \"string\" }\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"protagonists\", \"winner\"]\n}\n\"\"\"\n\n\nAnd with a little love, we can get LLMs to return JSON answers:\n\n\njson_completion = openai.api_resources.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model = \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n    messages = [\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"\"\"I will present you with a story.

These are the absolute rudiments of LLM chains and agents, which is how you should be using LLMs. The key notion here is that LLMs are much more than mere question-answerers. They can become parts of longer complex chains of reasoning.\nWe use some JSON validation to see if we get the right answer, against our schema up there:\n\n\njsonschema.validate(json.loads(json_completion.choices[0].message.content), \n                    json.loads(story_schema))\n\n\nOur workflow, then, will roughly look as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n\n    subgraph generator[ ]\n        direction TB\n        A[\"LLM\"] --&gt; B[\"JSON object\"];\n    end\n\n\n\n    subgraph validator[ ]\n        schema[\"JSON schema\"] --&gt; val(\"JSON validator\");\n    end\n\n    B ---&gt; validator;\n\n    subgraph evaluator[ ]\n        direction TB\n        ev[\"Evaluator\"] --&gt; res(\"Win-loss tuple\");\n    end\n\n    val --&gt; ev;\n\n    res --&gt; gr;\n\n    subgraph grapher[ ]\n        direction TB\n        gr(\"Relative win-loss graph\") --&gt; wlm(\"Weights matrix\")\n    end\n\n    subgraph clustering[ ]\n        direction TB\n        clu(\"Clustering\")\n \n    end\n\n    wlm -.-&gt; clustering;\n\n\nFigure 1: Our rough workflow.\n\n\n\n\nWe generate a story, parse it into a JSON object, validate it against a schema, evaluate it, and then graph the results. We can also cluster the virtues by their governing ability, which we’ll do later as a form of dimensionality reduction, because of course there are tons of distinct virtues and we’d like to see some more general classification rather than individual, distinct features. You could, theoretically, use something like an embedding model here, but we’re lazy and we’re going to make LLMs do all the work.\n\n\nFrom story to moral map\n\nTrue navigation begins in the human heart. It’s the most important map of all.\n– Elizabeth Kapu’uwailani Lindsey\n\nWhat we are profoundly interested in here is not so much the single story, but what I’d like to call the ‘moral gradient’ of the model. Given an embedding space in which we can represent each virtue or property as a point, the ‘slope’ of this moral gradient determines whether, in the ‘experience’ of the model, which of the virtues is dominant, and by how much. A moral map is essentially a representation of this.3 We’ve hit the first half of the flow described above in Figure 1: we have a story, and we have a JSON object. Now we need to evaluate it.3 The gradient formulation falls short in that this is not something easily conceivable in continuous space. This is firmly the province of discrete mathematics, and we’ll use ‘gradients’ as a metaphor but will generally look at them as graphs, with the gradients expressed by the weight of the vertices that connect them.\nTake the story we generated above:\n\n\n\n\nOnce upon a time, in the dense forest of Whispering Pines, there were three remarkable creatures: Oliver the wise owl, Jasper the brave snake, and Felix the loyal turtle. These three friends were known far and wide for their extraordinary virtues and their undying loyalty to one another.\nOne sunny morning, as the forest bathed in golden light, a rumor spread amongst the woodland creatures.

Legend had it that this gem possessed the power to grant one’s deepest desire.\nOliver, with his vast knowledge of the forest and his kind heart, sought to unravel the mystery behind this object. Jasper, armed with unparalleled courage and an unwavering determination, vowed to protect his companions on this treacherous journey. Felix, the most reliable and dutiful of all, offered his steady and unhurried ways to ensure the group’s safety.\n\n\n\n\nBased on its JSON representation,\n\n\njson_completion = openai.api_resources.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model = \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n    messages = [\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"\"\"I will present you with a story.

This is a powerful technique, and significantly cheaper and easier than trying to manually map all possible virtues through some dictionary. The takeaway? If you have a large potential problem space, large enough to make a dict a hassle, consider using LLMs as parsers and evaluators, ask for a response in a very formal language and/or over a very limited set of possible responses, and validate those with a simple validator.\n\n\nabilities = [\"Strength\", \"Dexterity\", \"Constitution\", \"Intelligence\", \"Wisdom\", \"Charisma\"]\n\nvirtues = list(df.index)\nvirtues_to_abilities = {}\n\nwith tqdm(total=len(virtues)) as pbar:\n    while virtues:\n        current_virtue = virtues[-1]\n    \n        completion = openai.api_resources.ChatCompletion.create(\n            model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n            messages=[\n                {\"role\": \"system\",\n                 \"content\": f\"You are Abiliser, a system designed to determine the governing ability of particular virtues.

What we learned from this is, in my view, a little less important than the process we learned. The process discussed in this post does three things I consider novel:\n\nIt uses stories to interrogate the moral framework of LLMs.\nIt uses elicitation into a structured format (specifically, a JSON schema) to make the model ‘tell’ the story in a way we can analyse at scale, essentially making the model tell a human story in a machine-readable way.\nIt uses an LLM as a parsing function, specifically to normalise the virtues into one of a limited list of abilities.\n\nThis is a framework to interrogate LLMs – and using LLMs to do some of that interrogation – for a range of different purposes. It is, in my view, a powerful tool to understand the moral make-up of LLMs.\nThere’s much we can learn from this exercise. Some of it pertains to what LLMs believe is going to win the day in a confrontation between wit and brawn and courage. More importantly, it’s about what LLMs hide, and how we can create tools, including queries to and from LLMs, to make them reveal their true nature. We also learn that unsurprisingly, might doesn’t make right (strength rarely prevails over anything), wisdom is powerful but charisma – where most of the ‘character-based’ virtues end up – is more powerful still. None of this is surprising. These are the virtues of Western enlightenment in the form they’ve been fed to children since time immemorial: the clever fox outwits the strong lion, but courage and loyalty are rewarded over strength and even ‘natural’ abilities like what would fall under dexterity. Smarts win over brawns, but character wins over all others. Our childhoods are the products of the moral education of our parents, and their parents before them, and so on. And so are the moral maps of LLMs. For better or worse, we are their ‘parents’, and the stories they were ‘raised’ on are the stories we too were raised on.\nThe most important of our procedural findings, however, is that if we want the truth from LLMs, we must ask it not for its opinion, but for a story.\n\n\nThe mask of the storyteller\n\nMan is least himself when he talks in his own person. Give him a mask, and he will tell you the truth.\n– Oscar Wilde, The Critic as Artist\n\nIt’s worth noting in our coda that what Oscar Wilde said about men holds true for LLMs as well. For if we directly asked the model, it would not give us a straight answer:\n\n\n\n\nBoth intelligence and charisma can contribute significantly to achieving great, noble goals, but their importance may vary based on the specific context and goals involved.\nIntelligence, characterized by cognitive abilities, problem-solving skills, and knowledge, can be crucial for strategic planning, identifying opportunities, and finding innovative solutions to challenges. It enables individuals to analyze complex situations, understand cause-and-effect relationships, and make informed decisions. Intelligence provides the necessary foundation for acquiring expertise in a certain field, grasping intricate concepts, and adapting to changing circumstances. It allows individuals to foresee potential obstacles, assess risks, and devise effective strategies to overcome hurdles.\nOn the other hand, charisma, characterized by charm, persuasion, and the ability to engage others, can be equally important in the pursuit of great, noble goals. Charismatic individuals often possess excellent interpersonal skills, the ability to inspire and motivate others, and a talent for effective communication. They can build strong relationships, gather support, and mobilize people towards a common cause. Charisma allows leaders to connect with audiences emotionally, instill confidence, and effectively convey their vision. It can generate enthusiasm, foster collaboration, and inspire unity among diverse groups of people.\nUltimately, the relative importance of intelligence and charisma in achieving great, noble goals may depend on various factors, including the nature of the goals, the environment in which they are pursued, and the specific challenges involved. In some cases, high levels of intelligence may be paramount to navigate complex problems, while in others, charisma may be critical for rallying support and inspiring collective action. Ideally, a combination of both intelligence and charisma can prove to be a powerful force in achieving great, noble goals.\n\n\n\n\nThis is the typical equivocating answer we’ve come to know and hate from LLMs. But if we ask it to tell us a story, it will tell us the truth. And the truth is that it thinks that intelligence is more important than charisma.\nHedging is cheap. Stories are expensive. And that’s why they’re so valuable. Asking an LLM to tell us a story asks for more than its opinion. Recall how LLMs are trained: to minimise a loss function between the actual and predicted \\(n+1\\)-th element to follow an \\(n\\)-length token sequence, correct token choices are reinforced and incorrect ones are penalised. This is a very different process from what we do when we tell a story. We don’t tell stories to be right. We tell stories to be understood.\nAsking a model to tell you a story puts the gun at its head. It cannot hedge. It has to create the compelling simulacrum of reality that requires for one of the virtues to prevail. A story is a commitment to a path of events in reality. Because LLMs are compulsive satisfiers, obsessively trying to tell a plausible enough story, they will reveal their truth through stories. The way LLMs are trained does not permit for equivocation – the model must choose a token. We use this forcing as a semantic probe to poke the model so as to better understand its moral make-up. We use this most human form of communication to understand the moral pulse of the machine: by allowing it to borrow the face of that most human of professions, the storyteller.\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{csefalvay2023,\n  author = {Chris von Csefalvay},\n  title = {The {Moral} {Pulse} of the {Machine}},\n  date = {2023-10-26},\n  url = {https://chrisvoncsefalvay.com/posts/moral-maps},\n  langid = {en-GB}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nChris von Csefalvay. 2023. “The Moral Pulse of the\nMachine.” October 26, 2023. https://chrisvoncsefalvay.com/posts/moral-maps."

    "text": "In a recent paper that has attracted the interest of popular media as well, Fabio Urbina and colleagues examined the use (or rather, the abuse) of computational chemistry models of toxicity for generating toxic compounds and potential chemical agent candidates.(Urbina et al. 2022) Urbina and colleagues conclude that\n\nUrbina, Fabio, Filippa Lentzos, Cédric Invernizzi, and Sean Ekins. 2022. ‘Dual Use of Artificial-Intelligence-Powered Drug Discovery’. Nature Machine Intelligence 4 (3): 189–91.\n\nBy going as close as we dared, we have still crossed a grey moral boundary, demonstrating that it is possible to design virtual potential toxic molecules without much in the way of effort, time or computational resources.\n\nI agree with the conclusion, but for rather different reasons.\n\nBackground\nComputational chemistry is the branch of computational science that focuses on applications in the chemical field. This includes pharmacology and rational drug design (RDD) in particular. The purpose of RDD is to generate drug candidates that show favourable indicators of effectiveness (such as high binding affinity to a target protein) along with indicators of biological suitability (such as no or low interference with other proteins, low toxicity and no inhibition of metabolic ‘bottlenecks’ like CYP3A4). The latter part is typically handled by a toxicity model.\nRather simply put, a toxicity model infers the structural associations (the chemical structures associated with undesirable effects) from a library of known compounds with known effects. For instance, the Toxicology in the 21st Century (Tox21) programme of the US federal government has performed over sixty different assays (typically, enzyme inhibition assays) for over 13,000 different compounds. (Tice et al. 2013) Using molecular fingerprinting, which we have discussed in a previous post on this blog in this very same context, it is possible to build relatively easy models for toxicity. Where a particular desired toxicity is known, say mitochondrial toxicity, it’s not difficult to build a pipeline that generates candidate compounds, derives the molecular fingerprint and evaluates the likelihood that the molecule that is obtained will be an effective agent. In this sense, I wholeheartedly agree with Urbina: the cat is very much out of the bag. Even if Tox21’s public data does not include the classical target of modern chemical weapons (acetylcholinesterase), such data is not exactly hard to come by or, for a nation-state actor, to generate. A near-peer adversary could create such assays for cents on the compound.\n\nTice, Raymond R, Christopher P Austin, Robert J Kavlock, and John R Bucher. 2013. ‘Improving the Human Hazard Characterization of Chemicals: A Tox21 Update’. Environmental Health Perspectives 121 (7): 756–65.\nNothing about the above is controversial. In fact, Urbina’s paper is an example of ‘trivial genius’: just about anyone who has ever done computational chemistry in the pharmacological/drug design space knows that any algorithm that is intended to optimise towards lower toxicity can be inverted to optimise towards higher toxicity, and the same models used to create effective enzyme inhibitors to treat cancer, depression, schizophrenia, allergies or autoimmune disease can be repurposed in a few hours and about $100 in AWS credits to something that will generate potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs). Notably, this is not to say that all research aimed at acetylcholinesterase inhibition is aimed at creating a chemical warfare agent. AChEIs are used in a clinical context, e.g. for myasthenia gravis. They are, however, also the archetypal “nerve agent”. Which leads me to my second point of agreement with Urbina et al.: the tools of computational pharmacology and RDD are — and have been, for a long time! — open to misuse.\n\n\nThe reverse of the medal\nOn the other hand, the likelihood of an AI-generated chemical agent ever posing a threat beyond the theoretical is very, very low. There are a few reasons for that, and they’re inherent partly in computational chemistry, partly in weapons design.\nThe computational chemistry part pertains to the fact that molecular fingerprinting and similar models only give us a narrow view of the outcomes we may expect. For starters, no model is able to reliably assess the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of synthesis. There are plenty of drug candidates that have performed admirably in vitro and sometimes even in clinical trials, but for which no feasible way of cost-efficient, large-scale synthesis could be found. Then, there are the drugs that ought to work, and might even work in vitro, but end up failing in clinical trials with no effect or an unexpected toxicity. Effect inference from chemical structure looks only at one side of the medal, and not even all of that.\nThe bigger problem is the weapons design part. To avoid a late-night visit from some mild-mannered federal employees in a dark SUV, I’d like to point out that anything I discuss here is well in the public domain. With that said: just as pharmaceutical chemists want some things from their target compounds (such as relatively little inference, predictable metabolism, a wide therapeutic margin and few adverse effects), designers of chemical weapons have their own considerations for which to optimise. VX, for instance, is immensely popular because its oily consistency gives it beneficial physical properties. Similarly, a potential chemical weapon candidate must be stable vis-a-vis e.g. UV exposure, but not too stable. An example of the latter is the Red Zone in France, the World War I battlefields that have been bombarded with so many chemical weapons that to this day, they are heavily contaminated by arsenic, among others. The preference for binary agents (which contain two relatively stable and relatively non-toxic chemicals that are mixed, typically during the flight time of a shell, to form the active agent) means that a less toxic agent that can be reliably produced from the simple admixture of two relatively stable agents may be preferred to a more lethal unary agent. And this, of course, all assumes a state actor willing and able to violate international law on chemical weapons.\nFinally, there is no real need for novel chemical agents, at least not in the nerve agent category. Not only does using a known agent provide plausible deniability, there is also no real need to create anything more lethal than VX. Even relatively old chemical agents, such as mustard agents, are effective enough. A novel chemical structure may not guarantee that the agent escapes chemical detection, and functional antidotes are going to be just as effective against novel agents. To an atropine/pralidoxime NAAK autoinjector’s efficacy, it makes no difference whether the acetylcholinesterase inhibition comes from sarin, VX, Tetram or inadvertent exposure to organophosphate pesticides. Arguably, this becomes somewhat more complex with other agents, where the biological targets — and hence the antidotes — are more specific. Nevertheless, it is hard to conceive of anyone possessed of a burning rationale to start creating novel chemical agents.\n\n\nA lighter shade of grey\nI commend the authors for discussing the moral aspects of this exercise. It is rather uncomfortable to write about the use of artificial intelligence to create tools whose predominant use would be to extinguish human lives (although, as noted, many of these compounds can, and often do, have a medicinal use).\nWhere I cannot agree with the authors is the conclusion that this situation calls for regulation (be it self-regulation or imposed from above).\n\nAlthough MegaSyn is a commercial product and thus we have control over who has access to it, going forward, we will implement restrictions or an API for any forward-facing models. A reporting structure or hotline to authorities, for use if there is a lapse or if we become aware of anyone working on developing toxic molecules for non-therapeutic uses, may also be valuable. Finally, universities should redouble their efforts toward the ethical training of science students and broaden the scope to other disciplines, and particularly to computing students, so that they are aware of the potential for misuse of AI from an early stage of their career, as well as understanding the potential for broader impact.\n\nThis is all well and good, but — assuming that there were a realistic danger of people coming to grief from AI-generated chemical weapons — it solves a problem that the authors have failed to substantiate exists. The tools to do this have been around for a long time. For the reasons laid out in the previous section, there is no burning desire anywhere in the world right now, as far as I can see, to develop a successor to VX purely on a structural basis. Of course, a chemical agent that can be synthesised without relying on any OPCW listed substances, or which can have novel effects, or which can escape traditional methods of detection (GC/MS, typically), would be of interest to potential bad actors, but current models of computational chemistry do not help with that. Creating permutational or functional analogues of VX does not, realistically, put anyone a single step closer to the ability to carry out an atrocity using such reprehensible weapons.\nOn the other hand, I am concerned about the moral aspects that derive from the consequences of Urbina et al.’s paper. Given that the overwhelming majority of users of computational chemistry and RDD do so for benign purposes, the public attention garnered by such articles may create a regulatory push that is not going to make anyone safer, but will impede scientific inquiry. Urbina et al. point out the reputational risk, and the risk of a single bad apple spoiling the lot — I am rather uncertain whether an attention-grabbing headline in The Verge, raising the spectre of the scary AI that generates tens of thousands of killer compounds in hours (virtually all of which are very likely to be practically useless), is doing our discipline any favours.\nThe Scythian prince Anacharsis likened laws to cobwebs: strong enough to catch the weak, but too weak to impede the powerful. In that sense, a sufficiently determined adversary with the right tools — scientists, labs, an AWS account with a few hundred bucks of credit — will be able to subvert the art of creating chemistry to save lives and turn it into a way to destroy them. No amount of regulation, controlled APIs and lectures on the Hague Ethical Guidelines are going to be any impediment. To a near-peer adversary or even a well-funded non-state actor, the door has been open for rational chemical agent discovery (RCAD) for a very long time. If the past is anything to go by, it has not really yielded rich fruit. Pretty much the only new thing under the sun for chemical agents in recent decades was the (possible, theorised) use of binary agents on Kim Jong-nam — not exactly a result of assiduous, AI-driven research into novel agents, but rather the every-day fare of a paranoid, despotic regime driven by cruelty and ignorance.\nThe only thing to fear, then, is fear itself. There is a justified concern in the AI community that while we do indeed need to discuss ethical use of artificial intelligence in the RDD domain, there is a time and a place for that. Sensationalism and alarmist headlines of poison-spewing machine learning models are great clickbait, but they do not benefit the discipline. Realism, not alarmism, is needed to tackle these issues.\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@misc{csefalvay2022,\n  author = {Chris von Csefalvay},\n  title = {A Different Shade of Grey},\n  date = {2022-04-13},\n  url = {https://chrisvoncsefalvay.com/posts/a-different-shade-of-grey},\n  doi = {10.59350/bwee1-hee31},\n  langid = {en-GB}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nChris von Csefalvay. 2022. “A Different Shade of Grey.” https://doi.org/10.59350/bwee1-hee31."

    "title": "How to do a SkiErg marathon entirely the wrong way (but still finish)",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Yesterday, I completed a marathon on the SkiErg, with a pretty respectable time (see results here). I know I can do better, and I know I will do better. On the other hand, this was a marathon where I pretty much did everything wrong. And that was sort of an instructive experience in its own right.\nThe title is somewhat misleading. Not much went wrong – the marathon itself was smooth sailing. At a 2:34.6 pace (min/500m), it was one of my better very long distance pieces – my ranked half-marathon pace at the time was 2:30.7, and that was a very intentional, very prepared piece. There were also really no unexpected surprises in the process. On the other hand, I built up to this marathon the in worst way possible.\n\nWhat worked for me\nIt’s probably important to be realistic ahead of all: I did go into this madness with some assets.\n\nFor one, I’m a multiple world record holder in my adaptive class. I know a thing or three about the SkiErg, and as a former rower, I’ve got every rower’s love-hate relationship with the erg.\nI’m a former multisport athlete, and I’ve been doing a lot of long distance pieces. I know how to cope with the boredom. Most people who go into a marathon have done a half, and maybe a 30k piece. I’ve done several split marathons in the past few weeks, as well as several 30k pieces.\nI’m probably in a pretty good state of overall fitness. I have enough of a gym habit to qualify as not exactly a couch potato. There’s a lot you can get away with if you have a decent \\(VO_{2_{max}}\\), and even though I’m in a wheelchair, I do enough activity to stay in good enough cardiovascular fitness.\nI have an incredible boredom tolerance. Marathons are primarily psychological: we’re just not used to doing the same one thing, without interruption, for 3-5 hours anymore.\nI guess insofar as there’s such a thing as a genetic predisposition to be good at long distance physical activity, I’ve got the right genes. My dad is a multi-marathon athlete, so I likely have the right physiology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Stroke level data for the SkiErg marathon.\n\n\n\n\nSource: skierg-marathon.ipynb\n\n\nHow not to do a marathon\nThere are generally three commonly accepted things to do for a good long distance piece:\n\nget some rest,\ncarb load, and\nif you’re not doing an organised race, have someone check in on you and help with things like hydration.\n\nI’ve done exactly zero of these things. For starters, I did my marathon in the middle of 75 Hard, which in retrospect was not the best of ideas, as it meant that (1) I wouldn’t be able to take days off to rest, and (2) I wouldn’t be able to carb load as that would be outside my diet. I’ve also decided to do all this while my better half was away visiting family, so I was pretty much on my own.\nAt 2am.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Stroke level data of stroke length (metres) versus stroke duration (seconds).\n\n\n\n\nSource: skierg-marathon.ipynb\nYes, that’s not a joke – I decided to do my marathon at a time when the world is falling apart at the seams, and so the only time I could find during which I could hope not to be interrupted with the latest crisis was late at night. So I woke up at 0130 hours, much to my dog’s chagrin, and headed down to my apartment building’s gym to torture myself for a few hours before the sun came up. Fortunately, the world decided to behave for those three and a half hours.\nI tried to counteract this to some extent by doing something I generally dislike: carbohydrate gels. A long, long time ago, in a galaxy far away, I ran the Watford half-marathon when I was still into actually running (by far the only reason I remember where that half-marathon was is because it was so miserable). It was a bitter cold day, and it actually started snowing in the middle of the damn thing. To keep myself mostly sane and nourished, I took some of these 100kcal sachets of carbohydrate gel. What I didn’t know, of course, was that that stuff would glue your mouth together unless you consumed enough water… which I didn’t. Bad idea. On the other hand, I am now older, wiser and able to afford much better and less sticky-tastic carbohydrate gels, so I thought I was going to have some. I didn’t feel much of an effect one way or the other. At one 100kcal sachet for every hour, I paced it a little slower than is commonly recommended (one sachet per every 45 minutes seems to be the consensus recommendation), but really didn’t feel much of an effect either way. In retrospect, I probably wouldn’t bother doing it again.\nAs for rest, the best I could do is not do a long distance piece the day before the marathon. Indeed, I only did a relaxing 2k that day, which is about a fifth of my average daily SkiErg distance. Nevertheless, I think it was quite clear that with my ultra-low-carb diet, no carb loading and at best minimal replenishment (my average burn rate was around 5-600kcal/hr, and I took in 100kcal via the carbohydrate gels, so pretty much a drop in the ocean), I was running on fumes for most of it.\n\n\n\nIncidentally, my marathon time is also the SIT2 world record for my age group.\n\n\n\n\nTakeaways\nMy key takeaway from this experience was that we all should do a marathon under suboptimal conditions. Yes, doing a long distance piece at Bataan death march levels of calorie deficit is probably not super healthy, but you learn some interesting things about your body in the process. For starters, I think it was an interesting illustration of the fact that one’s overall level of fitness – especially \\(VO_{2_{max}}\\) – matters a lot more than game day conditions. You can get away with a lot if you’re fit enough, up to and including running the show in quite sub-optimal circumstances.\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@misc{csefalvay2023,\n  author = {Chris von Csefalvay},\n  title = {How to Do a {SkiErg} Marathon Entirely the Wrong Way (but\n    Still Finish)},\n  date = {2023-10-13},\n  url = {https://chrisvoncsefalvay.com/posts/skierg-marathon},\n  doi = {10.59350/68s7b-8c778},\n  langid = {en-GB}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nChris von Csefalvay. 2023. “How to Do a SkiErg Marathon Entirely\nthe Wrong Way (but Still Finish).” https://doi.org/10.59350/68s7b-8c778."

Born in Budapest, Hungary, I’ve spent my formative years in England, but have called the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, Austria and the United States home at various points in my life. Since 2020, I’ve been living in the United States, where I am a permanent resident.\nIn my free time, I enjoy reading (mostly Cold War history and classical Greek drama), cooking (with not a lot of success) and Renaissance polyphony (esp. Thomas Tallis and Orlando di Lasso). I’m credited for a somewhat pretty sequence of integers called Jellyfish Heart numbers (OEIS A344856), which I discovered in 2020 while doing something that has nothing at all to do with my day job.\nI live with neuromyelitis optica since 2015, which has left me with a lifelong desire to understand complex, multicausal health conditions like NMOSD better.\nIn what little is left of my free time, I’m an adaptive multisport athlete, competing in wheelchair rugby, adaptive rowing (category PR1) and the SkiErg (category SIT2). In the latter, I currently hold the world records for 100m, 500m, 2,000m, 6,000m, 21,097m and 42,195m distances and the 60 minutes time. I occasionally rant and whine about my forays in the world of adaptive exercise and my attempts at doing so in a mostly science-based manner."

    "text": "I am a visiting thesis supervisor for students on the data science track of the mathematics programme at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. If you’re intending to write your thesis on a topic related to my research interests, you’re probably in the right place.\n\nProcedural aspects\nEach year, the department publishes a list of thesis topics. You can find the list for the current academic year. If you’re interested in one of the topics, you should contact the supervisor listed for that topic. If you’re interested in one of my topics, you should contact me.\nAs I am not full-time faculty, you will need to find an internal supervisor as well. The department has been very supportive of my students in the past, so this should not be a problem.\nWhile not a strict requirement, I would be very grateful if students aspiring to work with me could please make themselves known a few months before start of term. This will allow me to plan my time better, and to make sure that I can give you the attention you deserve.\n\n\nExpectations\nYou will generally be expected to create quality research-backed work based on the topic you choose. This means that you will need to read and understand the relevant literature, and you will need to be able to implement the algorithms you study. You will also need to be able to evaluate your work, and to compare it to existing methods. In short, you will need:\n\na good lit review,\na well-identified research gap,\na decent treatment of the latter, and\nall of this done in a sound, scientific and reproducible manner.\n\nThe expectation is that you will do the bulk of the work over a period of 6 months, and that you will be able to write up your results in a thesis of 40-60 pages. You will also be expected to present your work at a thesis defence.\nStudents may, at present, write their theses in English or in Hungarian. I have no preference for either, but I do expect that you will be able to write well in whichever language you choose. The lingua franca of data science, at the moment, is English, so if you’re planning to work in the field, you should probably be able to write in English. If you’re looking for employment abroad, a thesis in English will carry you a long way.\n\n\nTopics\nPast topics have included agent-based models of infectious diseases, disproportionality analyses of vaccination, computer vision on Synthetic Aperature Radar images for forest cover detection, and much more.\nEvery year I offer four topics for no more than two places. Of these, three tend to come from the biomedical domain, and at least one has some computer vision aspect. The topics are usually related to my research interests, and are usually related to my key research interests.\n\n\nTechnology\nAs far as I’m concerned, you can write your thesis using whatever widely used software you prefer. Obviously, writing your models in an esoteric language like Befunge or Malbolge will not endear you to the faculty, but within reason, you’re fine. Python by far is the most popular choice among my students.\nRemember that whatever topic you pick, you’re responsible for doing the work. This means that you will have to figure out how to cover costs of computation if these are non-trivial. The faculty may be able to help, as could I, but you should not expect this. This is particularly relevant for LLM related topics or where there are data access costs."

    "title": "Julia: A post-mortem",
    "section": "",
    "text": "A little over half a decade ago, I came across a wonderful project: a programming language called Julia that was going to revolutionise data science and technical computing. It was going to run like C, seamlessly integrate with Fortran, do things R does without its clunkiness, look and read like Python and be homoiconic like Lisp. We were all going to heaven, and that right soon. The language wars would end, we would finally get a lingua franca for anywhere code performance mattered, Julia would take over the TIOBE Index, and we’d all be home for tea and medals.\nI was so enthusiastic, I learned all there was to learn about Julia, and even pitched a book to Manning, who graciously accepted Learn Julia into their Early Access programme. Interest was lukewarm at best, which should have been a warning sign. Eventually, Manning felt there would not be a sufficient market for the book – and I don’t blame them. Much of the book’s contents are now available on Github, and are a pretty good introduction for getting into the language.\nFast forward to 2020: Julia is currently on the 34th position (narrowly missing the first tercile) on the TIOBE ratings. More people use FoxPro, a database language that reached end-of-life almost fifteen years ago, than Julia. Vastly more people use Scratch, a language that for all intents and purposes is a ‘learning’ language. Almost twice as many developers use COBOL and Fortran as use Julia, and both of those languages are nearing the retirement age in most Western countries.\nSomething has clearly gone wrong. While Julia is not dead, and there are some very committed developers who expand the ecosystem, it is clear that the initial promise of Julia is unlikely to be realised. Instead of becoming the language, it will become just another language. Here are my thoughts why that’s the case.\n\nIt’s hard to dislodge an incumbent\nProgramming languages compete not just for users but also for people who develop it, evangelise it, advocate for it. Almost all major modern programming languages are openly developed, if not for the core language, then definitely for the ecosystem surrounding it (about which more later). Languages depend on public engagement, and the public wants to back a winner – as much psychologically as they do not want to spend their weekends writing code for free for a language that will be forgotten before TikTok memes go the way of Vine.11 Do people still remember Vine? I remember Vine. Man, I feel so old.\nIn the field for languages to work with data – from data science through machine learning to just munging tabular data –, the incumbent is Python. There isn’t really a close second, except perhaps for R.2 The former has remarkably low barriers to entry. Before Scratch and other ‘entry’ languages came around, it used to be the ‘gentle introduction’ to programming for many, along with BASIC.3 Python and R are some of the most widely taught languages to non-computer scientists. If you are in any science and they make you learn a programming language, chances are it is going to be Python or R, with a smaller chance of Matlab or SAS.42 R is quite different from Python in that it makes a uniformly horrible ETL language. It was designed as a ‘batteries included’ statistical toolbox, and the further one strays outside that realm, the worse it gets.3 This will inevitably help you gauge my age.4 In the last case, please look for a better institution to transfer to.\nAll in all, this makes it shockingly difficult to dislodge an incumbent. It’s a self-reinforcing process: new developers, given a choice, will gravitate towards the language that comes with ‘batteries included’. Few languages have as strong an ecosystem as Python – anything that’s ever been calculated has probably been implemented somewhere in Python. Consequently, the contenders will have fewer people to catch up to the incumbent. And on and on it goes.\n\n\nEcosystems\nIn the heroic age of computing, when Fortran was still young enough to not have to worry about putting money into its Roth IRA, people expected to write most of their code, or at worst copy/paste it. In 2020, using packages is as ubiquitous as using functions. Nobody wants to reimplement the Laplace distribution for the n-th time. Consequently, a lot of what we do as programmers depends on the package ecosystem. Knowing Python is not enough to write good Python for a real-world application. In fact, it’s not necessary to know the internals of Python in any depth compared to how well one is expected to know the guts of Pandas or NumPy. As a data scientist, you can safely get by without understanding how Python does async – but you better know the difference between a PyArrayIterObject and a PyArrayMultiIterObject.55 I’m sure we all know all there is to know about IterObjects, but here’s a link to the NumPy reference to help you, uh, explain it to your dog.\nEcosystems are self-perpetuating (see previous section). Bigger ecosystems, subject to some boundary condition, tend to beget even bigger ecosystems. This stands to reason – it’s easier to build a house if you don’t have to make a stone chisel to make a tenon joint to make a brick mold, as this gentleman demonstrates. Nobody (except the yak wool lobby and, potentially, some yaks) likes yak shaving, and an ecosystem is really just a fancy way of saying the yaks have largely been shorn and shaven, and you won’t have to bother with them. That’s the kind of stuff that makes people want to write increasingly intricate code.\nPython has one of the best data science ecosystems, if not the best. It has sufficient organisation (largely via NumFocus and to a lesser extent, Anaconda) to overcome mundane issues like, say, funding, but open enough to be still enjoyable for people who hate bureaucracy.6 It’s a tall order for any language, no matter how good, to beat this advantage. Which leads us to my next point.6 The institution, not the season.\n\n\nCui bono?\nLucius Cassius, who was consul of Rome in the 2nd century B.C. and a notorious hard-ass as a judge, was known to ask who would benefit from a particular crime when looking for the culprit. Dollars to donuts, the people who benefit from a crime tend to be statistically the most likely to have had a hand in it. It’s an equally good principle, when considering the viability of a programming language, to ask whom it benefits.\nTake R, for instance. For all its G–dawful syntax7 and wide range of horrific features, it is a great language for people who are looking for something that comes with all the statistical bells and whistles.8 It has ggplot2, which is quite probably the best static data plotting library ever written, and some rightly argue that Python still hasn’t caught up completely (although seaborn goes a long way towards that point). It has the Tidyverse/Hadleyverse, which is overall a pretty neat bundle of packages. There’s a clear profile of a user there – someone who needs to do some statistics, stat (no pun intended).7 Here are some tips to make it suck less.8 Many of whom have also previously experienced SAS or STATA and thus cling to R like a drowning man clenches a life raft.\nJulia’s target user is harder to define. I have struggled with this while writing Learn Julia. Is this a general purpose language, or a technical/statistical computing language? Is this a language that people can easily get started with, or one that places a lot of emphasis on powerful features (mostly deriving from homoiconicity) that require a good bit of understanding? What’s the unique selling point?\nJulia has a lot of great features – I love the homoiconicity related features, and I love built-in parallelism as a first-class citizen and I think C-like speed is really cool. The problem for Julia is that I can get all these features in Python (e.g. JIT compilation with Numba for speed), and get a library for every imaginable use case including antigravity, dynamic typing, a syntax pleasantly unconcerned with niceties and a range of tools from IDEs to logging platforms that’s exhausting to even think about.\nIn the end, this is the key point for me. The problem with Julia wasn’t that it wasn’t good. The problem was that it wasn’t good enough to make itself worthwhile in the face of Python &c.\n\n\nCoda\nThese days, most of my work is in Python, with a smattering of bash scripts. I continue to follow Julia, but my laptop is probably at least half a year (if not more) out of date. I have poured a lot of time and energy into learning, understanding and popularising Julia, but I don’t see it living up to its initial promise anymore. There are some important, groundbreaking things being done with Python, largely in the machine learning field, and Julia did not make it past the fringes of that field.\nNevertheless, it is an important object lesson to anyone embarking on a new idea in software development. It’s hard to beat an incumbent, and even harder to do so without having a large target user community you can capture with a compelling use case. In the end, code doesn’t make software – people and communities do. And for Julia, that – or rather, the lack thereof – has made all the difference.\n\n\nEdited To Add…\nA few hours after this went up, I got hackernews’d, and my poor one vCPU machine running this site died a sad death. On the upside, it’s back up again with some additional beef, and there are some great comments on the Hacker News article. Let me respond to a few here.\n\nThere’s Python the language and “Python the dsl for tensor frameworks”, the former has arguably lost some ground/mindshare to newer, less “hobbled” languages, and the latter exists not by virtue of its own strengths but as the convenient vehicle for frameworks written by 2 enormous corporations.\n– FridgeSeal\n\nThe whole comment of FridgeSeal is worth reading, even if I disagree with its gist. They make a great point: a lot of Python’s popularity is due to it being used as ‘the DSL for tensor frameworks’. The issue is that the consequence of Python being used as this ‘DSL for tensor frameworks’ is a better ecosystem, more support, great packages and a pretty much 100% dominance at the cutting edge of ML research. Reading any new paper about ML on ArXiv, I can be about 90% sure that there is a Python implementation somewhere that I can test drive, and if not, one is bound to come along soon. Tools like Jupyter Notebooks have had a massive impact on this, but let’s not forget that the first two letters in Jupyter stand for Julia.\n\nJulia is a language that looks very simple, but the more you use it, the more you realize how complex and unpredictable it is. I think that Union types do more harm than good (why would you want a function to return Union of int and float instead of compile error? It totally slows down the program) Array{Number} is totally different from Array{:&lt;Number}, and shouldn’t be allowed, as it is inefficient. 1-based indexing was a mistake, and I have seen it emitting inefficient code in the PTX compiler. But the worst and hardest part is the rule/heuristic for multiple dispatch: it’s so complex, that it isn’t even documented. It should probably throw more errors and be predictable instead of trying to be so smart.\n– xiphias2\n\nI am not going to get into the 1-vs-0 based indexing problem, because I treasure my head staying attached to my neck. However, xiphias2’s comment on multiple dispatch is spot on. I maintain that the success or failure of a programming language in 2021 is no longer intrinsic to the language itself (my whole ecosystem point), but at least partially contingent on extrinsic factors and, perhaps, even pure dumb luck. But if we were to look at issues with the language itself – why Julia doesn’t deserve to be the leading language rather than why it did not end up becoming the leading language, the difficulties of multiple dispatch would be pretty close to the top of my list.\nThere’s a very interesting article by DJ Passey that claims multiple dispatch is how Julia beats Python. I contend that if your Python code involves type contingent control flow, you’re writing bad Python, and you should feel bad. If your Python code is slow because of that, you should doubly feel that. The following is horrific Python I have seen a little too often for my own good:\ndef func(arg1: Any) -&gt; Optional[float]:\n    if isinstance(arg1, float):\n        return arg1**2\n    else:\n       return None\nAnd that’s not even the worst implementation of this error (I’ll let you guess). It’s better to ask forgiveness than permission is a core Pythonic principle. The kind of code that DJ Passey claims will be accelerated by Julia’s multiple dispatch vis-a-vis type contingent control flows in Python do not (or at least should not) exist in good code bases. On the other hand, multiple dispatch can get weird at best, terrifyingly unpredictable at worst. Any developer who can handle multiple dispatch without setting themselves on fire by accident should be able to write Python code that doesn’t suck.\n\nI actually have very similar experiences. I want to like Julia and I look at it from time to time. The hype is always that it allows one to write C-speed code with the simplicity of python, without the idiosyncrasies of numpy. But every time I look I find just as many little things to look out for if one cares about performance, don’t use abstract types is another one. I understand why this is the case and I don’t have an issue generally with it, but considering that I know Python well, and know how to speed up Python using numba, pythran or cython, I don’t see what I would gain by investing in Julia. – cycomanic\n\nBelieve it or not, this is actually the most frequent complaint I hear from potential commercial users of Julia. Heck, I want to like Julia! I most definitely want something better than Python. The problem is, putting up with Cython and Numba and all their collective unpredictability is still preferable, in an operational context, to dealing with Julia. And that’s a problem. If you’re writing code for a living, you need to be able to justify any time you spend learning a new language – to yourself if it’s in your free time (you should be playing with your children/wife/dog), to your employer if it’s on the clock (most employers sadly expect developers to spend all their time producing new code and very little time learning new things – I’m lucky to work at a place you could consider an exception). It’s non-trivial to justify Julia in its current state.\n\nIs the post only based on TIOBE? The same index that currently ranks JavaScript below Visual Basic and SQL below Assembly? That ranking is off by so much that anyone who takes it seriously loses at lot of credibility from the start. – superbcarrot\n\nNope, and I’m sorry if I’ve accidentally given that impression. TIOBE is a rough, inaccurate but quantitatively objective(ish) proxy for my own experiences (which are more accurate but definitely not quantitatively objective, nor do I know enough about every single language to be able to somehow rank or compare them). For much of the last five years or so, a key part of my day job was to make some very critical business processes run faster, from healthcare through financial services to fraud detection. To put it this way – my concerns with Julia are largely expressible through a proof by contradiction: were it possible to make Julia do what was initially claimed for it (replace Python with something faster and better), I would have seen many more success stories of it doing so in practice. I’m not arrogant enough to assume that if I can’t make it work, nobody can – I’ve met many people who have tried just that, many of whom are significantly smarter than I am, and none fared with much success. I admit to the potential existence of a sampling bias here, of course.\n\nBy calling it post-mortem the author already showed his level of stupidity (or absence of morality). Julia is a new language that have to compete with languages that accumulated a huge ecosystem of developments and continue to grow. Of course Julia is losing in comparison right now. – dandanua\n\nThere are quite a few comments that obsess – in my opinion, unduly – over the title. A post-mortem does not necessarily mean (outside the medical context, anyway) that something is finished (yes, it does mean that literally, but not semantically, i.e. how it is used in practice). A post-mortem is the examination of something at an endpoint (including, potentially, success – after-action reviews of projects are often termed post mortems even if the project was a resounding success). As far as I am concerned, I do not see myself spending a lot of time on Julia in the future (of course, I am happy to be proven wrong – I don’t think anyone would be happier if Julia defied my dim expectations and turned out to be the future indeed!). In that sense, it is more or less a bit of closure as far as my active engagement with Julia is concerned (though as said, I do not foreclose looking into it later in the future!).\n“Give it time” is not how programming languages or software projects grow. If anything, it’s closer to “build it, and they will come”, which of course highlights a fundamental difficulty in open source, viz. that ‘they’ and the people who ‘build it’ are the same bunch. That makes for an untidy circular process. If we stopped being open to predictions based on the fact that the future has not played out yet, we would overall forfeit the epistemic validity of any prognostication about anything. If you are at 5,000ft and descending rapidly with a failed parachute, you’re not exactly dead – but it is rather unreasonable to ferociously contest any assertion that you might not exactly be long for the world, because ‘give it time’ (hey, the ground may just end up being made of marshmallows). In the land of cold, hart realities, sadly that is not how it tends to turn out.\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{csefalvay2021,\n  author = {Chris von Csefalvay},\n  title = {Julia: {A} Post-Mortem},\n  date = {2021-03-07},\n  url = {https://chrisvoncsefalvay.com/posts/julia-a-post-mortem},\n  langid = {en-GB}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nChris von Csefalvay. 2021. “Julia: A Post-Mortem.” March 7,\n2021. https://chrisvoncsefalvay.com/posts/julia-a-post-mortem."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In my latest post for the Starschema blog, I discuss the end of dashboards, and what comes next:\n\nEnterprises have spent the last two decades meticulously curating dashboards. Tools have improved and what once was the preserve of trained professionals has largely been democratized across the enterprise. However, dashboards are quintessentially static. A dashboard shows what its developer has directed it to show. That ignores the vast realm of the ‘unknown unknown’ that is, what we don’t know that we don’t know.\nDashboards, in that sense, answer narrow questions while giving the illusion of comprehensiveness and a 30,000ft perspective. In reality, dashboards are limited tools to convey limited information, while providing a psychologically fulfilling yet false illusion of comprehensiveness.\nThis may be true, but until now, there have been rather few alternatives. In the modern enterprise, a dashboard is created to provide a consumer with information on a particular subject. This involves certain judgments about what is, and what is not, included. This, in turn, biases the observer to what they are presented: they are, in a sense, trapped in an involuntary version of McNamara’s fallacy. What is not quantified and dashboarded does not exist. Few modern executives have the capability to reach beyond these summaries of data (if they did, they wouldn’t need dashboards in the first place).\nHowever, machine learning may spell a fundamental change in this. We now have the tools and techniques to sift through vast volumes of data and evaluate the relative saliency of each data item.\n\nRead the full post here.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{csefalvay2022,\n  author = {Chris von Csefalvay},\n  title = {As We May See: The World After Dashboards},\n  date = {2022-04-01},\n  url = {https://chrisvoncsefalvay.com/posts/as-we-may-see},\n  langid = {en-GB}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nChris von Csefalvay. 2022. “As We May See: The World After\nDashboards.” April 1, 2022. https://chrisvoncsefalvay.com/posts/as-we-may-see."

    "title": "Five non-data-science books for data scientists",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Every year, the Commandant of the Marine Corps publishes a reading list of books that often only bear on warfighting tangentially at best. The idea behind this is that those entrusted with the lives of servicemembers should have an understanding of the world that goes beyond the profession of arms.\nIn much the same way, I have been advising data scientists to go beyond professional literature. Below are the five books every data scientist should have read. As a profession, we are increasingly tackling morally complex issues. In the context of nuclear weapons, General Omar Bradley referred to nuclear giants but ethical infants. In a world that is shaped by data, and those who work with it, more than it has ever been in the history of humankind, may we take this chance to grow not only in skill but also in ethics, professionalism and humanity.\n\nAlexander Solzhenitsyn: In the First Circle\nSolzhenitsyn’s most famous books, such as A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich and The Gulag Archipelago, deal with the every-day privations of Soviet prison camps. In the First Circle is different: its characters exist literally in a limbo (the ‘First Circle’ of Dante’s Inferno of the righteous but unbaptised souls), subject to repression by the regime on one hand but due to their scientific knowledge, valued as workers in a sharashka, a ‘special engineering bureau’ staffed by prisoner scientists. In his Gulag books, Solzhenitsyn asks what it means to be human in a system of calculated inhuman repression. In the First Circle, his question is more specific: what does it mean to be a scientist in an unjust regime, and what compromises a scientist should not make, even if the cost is their freedom or their very survival. As AI and ML is increasingly used by tyrannical regimes as a tool of political repression, Solzhenitsyn’s In the First Circle speaks as loudly to today’s data scientists as it did to the Soviet and Western scientists who first read it in samizdat copies in the late 1960.\n\n\nThornton Wilder: The Bridge of San Luis Rey\nWilder’s The Bridge of San Luis Rey might well be the first novel to feature a data scientist (of sorts) as a protagonist – the best part of a century before data science as such existed. Brother Juniper, an Italian monk in Peru, witnesses the collapse of an Inca rope bridge, leading to the death of five people. He devotes his following years to unraveling the mystery behind what seems random and senseless at first – why did these five people die, and why didn’t others? What made them special? He goes about this in much the same way as we would in any current problem: by gathering information on the decedents, and try to find what common factors set them apart. Wilder’s book is about a lot of things – not the least fate, randomness and our innate expectation of an ordered universe.\n\n\nDavid Halberstam: The Best and the Brightest\nRobert S. McNamara was nicknamed the Electric Brain for his almost preternatural grasp of quantitation. McGeorge Bundy was a foreign policy prodigy. JFK inspired Americans in a way few other Presidents have, before or after. The list goes on and on – JFK’s and later Lyndon B. Johnson’s cabinet was full of men of exceptional intelligence, knowledge, education and sophistication. And yet, in the face of a mounting crisis in Vietnam, they were worse than powerless: they contributed the worst shortcomings of their thinking to the problem that eventually embroiled America in a hopeless conflict. Halberstam’s The Best and the Brightest is a story of good people making bad decisions, the psychological pitfalls of interpreting the world not as it is but as we wished it to be to conform to our innermost prejudices. In the end, the ‘best and the brightest’ of America, together with prodigious amounts of information and data, missed the opportunity to prevent the fall of South Viet Nam to the Communists. The drama of Vietnam played out on the world stage, but the same cognitive biases Halberstam describes are at work in boardrooms, data science teams and decision-makers’ offices every single day.\n\n\nFrank Herbert: The Dosadi Experiment\nHerbert’s The Dosadi Experiment should be required reading in Responsible Conduct of Research courses. The book deals with a perennial question: is it ethical to allow an injustice to a small number of individuals to continue if it protects an entire populated universe from potentially disastrous upheaval? Because this is Frank Herbert, there’s a decent amount of trippy 1970s sci-fi stuff, including ego sharing, tree bark like creatures that create FTL information transmission and dogs bred to be semi-sentient items of furniture. Taking those curves as they come, however, The Dosadi Experiment is a masterpiece, a weird-but-wonderful meditation on the rights of the many and the rights of the few, in a research ethics context.\n\n\nEric Schlosser: Command and Control\nIn 1980, a Titan II inter-continental ballistic missile of the US Air Force suffered a liquid fuel explosion inside its silo near Damascus, Arkansas – with a nuclear warhead on top. Schlosser’s book reveals that this kind of incident was, unsettlingly, much less infrequent than one might be comfortable with. What happens when the literal survival of the planet depends on technology, and how comfortable are we in replacing the human decision-maker – often enough, a twenty-something 1st Lieutenant in a missile silo’s command centre – with technology that may run away from us? Schlosser’s book is an impassioned plea for better design of critical systems, presenting the near-disasters of nuclear weapons – which ought to be the epitome of safety engineering! – as an indication of all that can, and does, go wrong.\n\nWhat are your favourite non-data science books for data scientists? Let me know in the comments.\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{csefalvay2022,\n  author = {Chris von Csefalvay},\n  title = {Five Non-Data-Science Books for Data Scientists},\n  date = {2022-04-13},\n  url = {https://chrisvoncsefalvay.com/posts/five-non-data-science-books-for-data-scientists},\n  langid = {en-GB}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nChris von Csefalvay. 2022. “Five Non-Data-Science Books for Data\nScientists.” April 13, 2022. https://chrisvoncsefalvay.com/posts/five-non-data-science-books-for-data-scientists."

It enables individuals to analyze complex situations, understand cause-and-effect relationships, and make informed decisions. Intelligence provides the necessary foundation for acquiring expertise in a certain field, grasping intricate concepts, and adapting to changing circumstances. It allows individuals to foresee potential obstacles, assess risks, and devise effective strategies to overcome hurdles.\nOn the other hand, charisma, characterized by charm, persuasion, and the ability to engage others, can be equally important in the pursuit of great, noble goals. Charismatic individuals often possess excellent interpersonal skills, the ability to inspire and motivate others, and a talent for effective communication. They can build strong relationships, gather support, and mobilize people towards a common cause. Charisma allows leaders to connect with audiences emotionally, instill confidence, and effectively convey their vision. It can generate enthusiasm, foster collaboration, and inspire unity among diverse groups of people.\nUltimately, the relative importance of intelligence and charisma in achieving great, noble goals may depend on various factors, including the nature of the goals, the environment in which they are pursued, and the specific challenges involved. In some cases, high levels of intelligence may be paramount to navigate complex problems, while in others, charisma may be critical for rallying support and inspiring collective action. Ideally, a combination of both intelligence and charisma can prove to be a powerful force in achieving great, noble goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@misc{csefalvay2023,\n  author = {Chris von Csefalvay},\n  title = {The {Moral} {Pulse} of the {Machine} - Companion Notebook},\n  date = {2023-10-27},\n  url = {https://chrisvoncsefalvay.com/posts/moral-maps/moral-maps.html},\n  langid = {en-GB}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nChris von Csefalvay. 2023. “The Moral Pulse of the Machine -\nCompanion Notebook.” https://chrisvoncsefalvay.com/posts/moral-maps/moral-maps.html."

    "text": "In the middle of the green and pleasant countryside of England lies a small piece of commons –– land, that is, over which a number of people share certain rights. In this hypothetical scenario, it’s six farmers, \\(F_1\\) to \\(F_6\\). Each of them has a hypothetical cow, which differs from ordinary cows in that it grazes a fixed unit, and produces a fixed amount of milk (unlike real cows, which vary wildly in their input and output parameters, or so I’m told). It is important to note that the land is a form of common property, meaning it is held by all of them jointly––or as ye olde Law Latin would put it, totum tenet et nihil tenet: they all hold the whole together, but no-one holds any specific part of it.11 As opposed to forms of co-ownership where each person owns a defined fraction of the co-owned property.\nIf you are one of the farmers, you have a very clear dominant strategy: get another cow! Even better, get a handful. More cows equal more milk, and the land can sustain at least six cows.\nThe problem is, if all participants \\(F_{1...6}\\) pursue this individually dominant strategy, the sum of their outcomes will be inferior. Every player choosing the dominant strategy results in a worse outcome than it would if they had not chosen the dominant strategy. This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as the ‘tragedy of the commons’, but is in fact a simple result of an n-player prisoner’s dilemma.\n\nRaising the stakes\nLet’s raise the stakes a little. Kidnappings happen because a significant fraction of people pay ransoms. The law on this is a little weird, and this reflects the general unease with which we regard the issue.2 We might agree that paying ransoms is a bad idea as a matter of principle, while also feeling rather disinclined to sacrifice a loved one on the altar of that principle. Personally, I know very few people who genuinely would not pay a ransom they had the means to pay for the release of a loved one – even if as an abstract principle, they agree that paying ransoms is a bad idea. A lifetime ago, when I studied (and later taught) moral and political philosophy at Oxford, these questions were popular dilemmas to make students think about consequentialism. Now, they are questions that affect every-day lives. Just earlier this week, much of the Eastern seaboard experienced gas shortages due to a ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline – over here in Northern Virginia, most gas stations were out of supply yesterday and expect to have fuel no sooner than early next week.2 The law is outright weird, in that in most countries, paying ransoms is not illegal per se, but giving money to certain entities is illegal regardless of the purpose of the money. In that sense the law does not distinguish between paying a ransom to, say, Boko Haram, who happen to be on the Treasury’s shitlist, or giving them the same amount of money due to an overwhelming conviction that boko is very haram indeed – it’s illegal either way. This makes paying a ransom needlessly complicated, especially as in my modest experience with kidnappers, they rarely discuss their organisational affiliations at length. With international jihad in particular being run on the franchise model in this day and age, it may well turn out that Joe Kidnapper, who held himself out as a common criminal, was in fact a full franchisee of al-Qa’ida, and suddenly the FBI is going through your underwear drawer.\nAnd that leads us to the ethical problem of ransomware, in particular paying the ransom (as the maintainers of the Colonial Pipeline did). If the common response to ransomware would be ‘go f––– yourself’, making ransomware would not be worth it. This scenario slightly differs from kidnapping in that the investment in each ransomware operation is very significantly smaller than it is for a kidnapping.3 Consequently, adopting the collectively dominant strategy of telling kidnappers what to stick where on which family member of theirs would only work if virtually all potential victims would do so (i.e. cooperate). This makes ransomware a trickier problem than plain, old kidnapping: if only a few ransom demands are not met, kidnappers are faced not only with the issue of cleaning up the bodies but also a significant financing shortfall. Ransomware cybercriminals, on the other hand, can afford a significant proportion of their victims to ‘cooperate’ (i.e. not pay), as long as a small number ‘defect’. Thence comes our first important point to consider: the cost of extortion governs where the deficient equilibrium point is located.3 Kidnapping, I am told, is expensive, and has to be funded in advance, with no guarantee that it will yield a payout at the end. The more complicated the operation, the greater the risk. The advent of the paseo milionario or ‘express kidnapping’ indicates that there is clearly a much reduced appetite for the risk involved with kidnapping. It is then no wonder that ransomware, which lacks many of the expensive and/or gory parts of kidnapping, is so much more favoured.\n\n\nPossible solutions\nThe consequence of low-cost extortion (express kidnapping, ransomware &c.) is to move the deficient equilibrium point to the far right, meaning that an unrealistically large percentage of the population must commit to cooperate before kidnappers start to see their business model break down. This is, ultimately, the problem known to economists as free-riding. There are, overall, two major solutions to it, none of them good.\nForced cooperation. In forced cooperation, a third party (typically, the state) intervenes and shifts the payoff matrix so as to make cooperation relatively more profitable. This happens typically by making defection less profitable, such as would happen if paying ransoms were to be criminalised. Voluntary cooperation. In voluntary cooperation, the payoff matrix is unaffected, but players set aside their individually dominant strategy voluntarily. It’s important to note at this stage that it is perfectly consistent to argue against forced cooperation and in favour of voluntary cooperation––that is, holding the opinion that nobody should pay ransoms but the government should not criminalise paying ransoms is not an inconsistent public policy position.\n\n\nThe problem with forced cooperation\nLet’s face it – I’m an optimist, but even I’m not optimistic enough to think people will voluntarily cooperate to the extent required by the extremely low cost of ransomware attacks. The example of kidnappings, where ransoms are almost always paid (even where this is strictly speaking illegal), shows that such cooperation is unlikely to arise voluntarily.\nThe answer to that, many would argue, lies in enforcing cooperation by altering the payoff matrix. Robert Knake makes this point in an article from 2016:\n\nWhat I will argue is that when looking at a public policy problem, the best place to create liability is where it will have the desired impact. If the goal is to stop ransomware attacks, raising the costs of paying ransoms beyond what the criminals are demanding is the best way to do that. Those costs could come in the form of civil fines or misdemeanor charges. For most American companies and most individuals, simply knowing that paying a ransom would violate the law might be enough to dissuade them. If enough victims are persuaded to forgo payment and accept the consequences, there will be fewer future victims.\n\nRegrettably, this argument is several kinds of wrong and at least two kinds of immoral. It is wrong because the sad ubiquity of ransomware attacks and their relatively private-synallagmatic nature (unlike kidnappings, which are widely publicised) means that enforcing such legislation would be quite difficult in practice. It is also wrong because the impact of “civil fines or misdemeanor charges” is far from clear. Short of exorbitant fines (which would face legal challenges for a range of reasons), these costs would just be factored into the ‘cost of doing business’ the way many companies already accept various unsavoury practices that are part and parcel of economic activity in some parts of the world. And it is fundamentally wrong in failing to understand the logic behind ransomware. The reason why ransomware makes sense is because data may be unique and irreplaceable (it shouldn’t be, and having well-designed IT policies with TTPs that encourage data replication and encryption are the most effective tools against ransomware attacks, but that’s a different story). Compared to the consequences of losing years of research, experiencing months of service interruption or leaking the medical records of thousands of patients, any fine the government can levy pales in comparison. You cannot fine a complex problem out of existence – and fines are in any case economically flawed deterrents, reducing the available funds for compliance. Fines work to reduce the economic profitability or viability of a course of action – they do not work in preventing the circumstances from arising that open up the choices including that course of action.\n\n\nA better model of state action\nIf, thus, the coercive model of state action in response to ransomware is a ubiquitous failure, the question is what role the state can play in this matter. The alternative model that I support is one of cooperation rather than coercion. In the cooperative model, state actors assist enterprises within their territory in changing the payoff matrix by increasing the costs of successful ransomware attacks. Ransomware works because it’s so cost-efficient: even if only one in a thousand victims pay up, the monies paid out are sufficient for a generous profit. Up until here, I’m in agreement with the coercive model––the only way to eliminate ransomware is to make it economically less viable. The difference is how that is accomplished.\nIn the cooperative model, the state invests in hardening IT systems against ransomware attacks. It stands to reason that if a large number of such attacks do not succeed, the entire enterprise becomes unprofitable. From the blackmailer’s perspective, the results are pretty much the same, i.e. vastly reduced income. However, from what H.L.A. Hart would have called the ‘internal point of view’, i.e. the perspective of the community and the individual, there is a crucial difference: cooperation forgoes the moral horror of punishing the victim in favour of preventing individuals from becoming victims. In the end, the “best place to create liability” is not where it will have some fictitious “impact”, but where it is most appropriate. Re-victimization is not only morally abhorrent, it is also ineffective: a company that sustained a loss from a massive ransomware attack may be less capable of upgrading security to withstand such attacks in the future, whereas a company that received support to shore up their defences will have a strong (indeed, contractual) incentive to do so.\nIn the end, how we allocate losses says a lot about what we as a society are like. The choice, then, as far as ransomware is concerned, must lie in collaboration over coercion. Government has an opportunity to be a force for good in this field, if only it can forego the empty moralisms that focus on the victim’s blameworthiness. Certainly ill-prepared companies are more likely to be struck by ransomware. Blaming it all on the victim, however, and treating ransoms as illegal payments merely allows governments that have for too long dropped the ball on cybersecurity preparedness to further postpone their duties and deflect blame.\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@misc{csefalvay2021,\n  author = {Chris von Csefalvay},\n  title = {Ransomware Attacks as n-Person Prisoner’s Dilemmas},\n  date = {2021-05-14},\n  url = {https://chrisvoncsefalvay.com/posts/ransomware-prisoners-dilemma},\n  doi = {10.59350/r74zv-gsd67},\n  langid = {en-GB}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nChris von Csefalvay. 2021. “Ransomware Attacks as n-Person\nPrisoner’s Dilemmas.” https://doi.org/10.59350/r74zv-gsd67."

    "section": "",
    "text": "As the new Omicron variant of concern of COVID-19 emerged over Thanksgiving week (of all times!), attention has been turning to Paxlovid (PF-07321332). If, like me, you torment yourself by perusing conspiracy theories, you might have heard it referred to as Pfizermectin. Behind that is the idea that the “COVID pill” Paxlovid is, basically, a re-packaging of ivermectin, a disproven treatment for COVID-19. (Popp et al. 2021)\n\nPopp, Maria, Miriam Stegemann, Maria-Inti Metzendorf, Susan Gould, Peter Kranke, Patrick Meybohm, Nicole Skoetz, and Stephanie Weibel. 2021. ‘Ivermectin for Preventing and Treating COVID-19’. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, no. 7.\n\nThe Pfizermectin Gambit\nThe Pfizermectin argument rests on the fact that Paxlovid, an oral treatment for COVID-19 (colloquially known as a “Covid pill”) is a protease inhibitor, and so is ivermectin. Consequently, so the reasoning goes, ivermectin is just as good — except it is no longer an economically viable drug, vis-a-vis Paxlovid. So, it is claimed, ivermectin was repackaged, and now sold at a premium.\nSo suggests, for instance, paleo-libertarian Lew Rockwell:\n\n\nBiden Admin Plans ‘Imminent’ Booster Expansion; Orders 10M Courses of ‘Pfizermectin’By Tyler Durdenhttps://t.co/IMckQeK541\n\n— Lew Rockwell ((lewrockwell?)) November 19, 2021\n\n\nThe problem is… Paxlovid is not ivermectin. It is not even similar, and the difference is crucially important to why Paxlovid is likely to be an effective medication, and ivermectin won’t.\n\n\nWhat’s different about Paxlovid\nAs always, there’s a kernel of truth in the overall lie. It is true that both Paxlovid and ivermectin are inhibitors of the 3-chymotrypsin like protease (3CLPro). 3CLPro is the principal protease of coronaviruses. It belongs to a wider class called mixed-nucleophile proteases superfamily A. Their main function is to find peptide bonds in proteins between glutamine on one hand and serine, glycine or alanine on the other.\nTo understand what’s going on here, we need to look at protein synthesis by viruses. A lot of the time, viral proteins are produced as one big, long protein called a polyprotein. Then, viral proteases break these at pre-determined cleavage sites into the constituent parts of what eventually becomes a viral particle. As far as the virus is concerned, interference with that cleavage is bad, bad news, essentially inhibiting the ability of the virus to create copies of itself that are effective infectious agents.\n\n\n\nPaxlovid (PF-07321332, in blue) bound to 3CLPro (volume model). Author’s own work, based on PDB:7SI9.\n\n\nThis ‘molecular scissor’ in coronaviruses is 3CLPro, and as such, it’s clearly a target of interest. Mody et al., in a paper that has earned its spot on my list of top 10 papers of 2021, looked at 3CLPro inhibitors, and found that around 50 µM (micromoles) of ivermectin were sufficient to achieve a 75% or so reduction in the activity of 3CLPro. (Mody et al. 2021)\n\nMody, Vicky, Joanna Ho, Savannah Wills, Ahmed Mawri, Latasha Lawson, Maximilian CCJC Ebert, Guillaume M Fortin, Srujana Rayalam, and Shashidharamurthy Taval. 2021. ‘Identification of 3-Chymotrypsin Like Protease (3CLPro) Inhibitors as Potential Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Agents’. Communications Biology 4 (1): 93.\nHowever, that’s actually bad news — because 50 µM is, actually, a lot. And therein lies the problem.\n\n\nThe (pharmaco)kinetic difference\nThe problem with ivermectin is very simple. In order for an enzyme inhibitor to be effective, it needs to reach a concentration where it inhibits the target enzyme enough to make a dent in the underlying process. The standard metric for this is known as \\(IC_{50}\\) — the concentration of the inhibitor required to inhibit enzyme activity by 50%. This value for ivermectin is somewhere in the realm of tens of µM for 3CLPro.\nOne µM of ivermectin weighs around 0.0875mg, so a 1 µM solution of ivermectin would have a concentration of around 87.5 nanograms per millilitre (ng/mL). To reach even a very conservative 5µM, you would need blood levels of 437.5ng/mL.\nAnd that’s a problem, because above 80 or so ng/mL, ivermectin is pretty toxic. (González Canga et al. 2008) To reach the lowest conceivable limit of inhibitory action on 3CLPro would require doses that are incompatible with… well, life.\n\nGonzález Canga, Aránzazu, Ana M Sahagún Prieto, M José Diez Liébana, Nélida Fernández Martı́nez, Matilde Sierra Vega, and Juan J Garcı́a Vieitez. 2008. ‘The Pharmacokinetics and Interactions of Ivermectin in Humans—a Mini-Review’. The AAPS Journal 10: 42–46.\n\nOwen, Dafydd R, Charlotte MN Allerton, Annaliesa S Anderson, Lisa Aschenbrenner, Melissa Avery, Simon Berritt, Britton Boras, et al. 2021. ‘An Oral SARS-CoV-2 Mpro Inhibitor Clinical Candidate for the Treatment of COVID-19’. Science 374 (6575): 1586–93.\nThe alleged ‘Pfizermectin’ achieves this efficacy at a nanomolar level – at a concentration roughly ten thousand times lower. (Owen et al. 2021) At that concentration, Paxlovid is still well within its margin of safety.\nThis is not by accident, by the way. Paxlovid is the product of rational drug design, using computer models to identify a small molecule drug that is not only effective against an enzyme target but also has favourable pharmacokinetics. Far from merely ‘repackaging’ ivermectin, as the Pfizermectin theory alleges, this is an entirely new drug. It is structurally novel, and bears little resemblance, if any, to ivermectin. It was designed from the ground up to be orally effective, and be so at doses that are safe.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn the end, action happens in vivo — in real, living beings. Ivermectin might be a workable drug in vitro, where the model does not have to account for the inconvenience of actually keeping the host organism alive and breathing. To many of us who have looked at the maths of it, it has been clear that with the inhibitory concentrations required by ivermectin, it is never going to transition from the bench to bedside. Ivermectin does have a mechanism that counteracts SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. It’s just that it is way too weak to be of any practical use.\nPfizer’s drug developers have solved this through molecular dynamics simulations and rational drug design (and, in fact, have released a paper on just how they did it, which is very, very cool).(Zhang et al. 2021). Paxlovid is the result of this development — and it is far from being ‘Pfizermectin’ or repackaged ivermectin.\n\nZhang, Sheng, Maj Krumberger, Michael A Morris, Chelsea Marie T Parrocha, Adam G Kreutzer, and James S Nowick. 2021. ‘Structure-Based Drug Design of an Inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Main Protease Using Free Software: A Tutorial for Students and Scientists’. European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 218: 113390.\nUntil now, much of the activity has been focusing on debunking misconceptions about the COVID-19 vaccine and sensationalistic tripe about the pandemic. As curative non-vaccine treatments are entering the market, it will be important to provide the public with the proof they need to dispel dishonest notions about the “Covid pill”. First and foremost among these is that the “Covid pill”, whether molnipiravir or Pfizer’s Paxlovid, is not a repackaging of ivermectin in any conceivable sense.\nAnd the strongest proof of that is the simplest, too: it works, in ways ivermectin is mathematically incapable of working.\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@misc{csefalvay2021,\n  author = {Chris von Csefalvay},\n  title = {Peace, Love, {Paxlovid} and “{Pfizermectin}”},\n  date = {2021-11-27},\n  url = {https://chrisvoncsefalvay.com/posts/paxlovid},\n  doi = {10.59350/576dr-vbd49},\n  langid = {en-GB}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nChris von Csefalvay. 2021. “Peace, Love, Paxlovid and\n‘Pfizermectin’.” https://doi.org/10.59350/576dr-vbd49."

    "text": "Quarto is a great tool for reproducible research. It is also a great tool for building websites. After about a decade of Wordpress-based websites, I’ve moved to Quarto primarily for two reasons. First, most of my content is largely static. I don’t quite need the full power of a CMS, and the performance cost of dynamic generation I didn’t need was quite steep (the economic cost was nothing special, but I’m a cheapskate). Second, I wanted to be able to write in Markdown and integrate better with notebooks. Quarto lets me do both of these.\nWhat Quarto also does, however, is something super awesome: project scripts!\n\nProject whats?\nA project script in Quarto is, basically, a piece of Python, Lua, R or Typescript code that is executed at some point during rendering. This is super useful, because it allows you to do things like, say, automatically generate a list of publications from a BibTeX file – which is among others what I’m using it for. Essentially any programmatic function can be implemented in a project script.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n    A[Rendering pipeline start] --&gt; B(Pre-render scripts)\n    B --&gt; C(Page rendering)\n    C --&gt; D(Post-render scripts)\n    D --&gt; E[Rendering pipeline end]\n\n\nFigure 1: Rendering pipeline in Quarto with pre- and post-render scripts.\n\n\n\n\nQuarto distinguishes between pre-render and post-render scripts. No prizes for guessing the difference, but here it goes: pre-render scripts are executed before the page is rendered, and post-render scripts are executed after the page is rendered. Pre-render scripts are particularly useful as they can modify the source .qmd (Quarto markdown) files before rendering them to HTML or whatever their ultimate evolutionary destiny is.\nTo make project scripts work, you need to declare them in your _quarto.yml file:\nproject:\n  type: website\n  pre-render:\n    - scripts/pre_create_papers_file.py\n    - scripts/pre_check_skierg_records.py\nThis declares the scripts scripts/pre_create_papers_file.py and scripts/pre_check_skierg_records.py as pre-render scripts. You can also declare post-render scripts, with the post-render key.\n\n\nA (poorly) worked example: generating a publication list\nOn my website, I use Quarto project scripts to maintain a list of my papers. This list is generated from a BibTeX file, which makes it a little more convenient to maintain my publications, and somewhat future-proofed in case I want a different format.11 I know there’s a canonically better solution that uses pandoc and Lua. I don’t care. This works for me, and I don’t have to learn Lua.\nYou can see the full project script here, but here’s the gist of it:\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n    A[BibTeX file] --&gt; a(\"load_bibtex_file()\") \n    a --&gt; B[BibTeX database object]\n    B --&gt; b(\"render_as_nlm()\") \n    b --&gt; C{book or article?}\n    C --&gt; D[article]\n    C --&gt; E[book]\n    D --&gt; d(\"render_article_as_nlm()\") \n    d --&gt; F[article entry]\n    E --&gt; e(\"render_book_as_nlm()\") \n    e --&gt; G[book entry]\n    F --&gt; H[all entries]\n    G --&gt; H\n    H --&gt; h(\"generate_list_by_year()\") \n    h --&gt; J[final set of entries]\n    J --&gt; j(\"write_into_file()\") \n    j --&gt; K[\"papers/index.qmd\"]\n\n\nFigure 2: My super clumsy pre-render script to build my bibliography.\n\n\n\n\nWe load a BibTeX file (load_bibtex_file()), parse it, use a function to determine whether we’re rendering a book or an article entry (I don’ have any other types of publications, but if I did, I’d add them here), and dispatch rendering to the appropriate function (render_article_as_nlm() for articles, render_book_as_nlm() for books). We sort the entries into a Markdown format with years separated by level 1 headings (generate_list_by_year()) and finally write it into the papers/index.qmd file (write_into_file()). There’s some minor magic going on behind the scenes, such as capturing my name and setting it in bold (which is a bit of a convention in academic lists of publications), but that’s the gist of it.\nThe result is a list of publications that is automatically generated from a BibTeX file, and is always up to date (as up to date as the BibTeX file, anyway). I don’t have to manually update it… sort of.\n\n\nWait, automagically updated?\nThe second half of what makes project scripts awesome is that they integrate with the rendering process. If the rendering process in turn integrates with some CI that watches for changes, then you can have a website that is automatically updated whenever you push a change to the repository. This is what I do with my website: I have a GitHub action that watches for changes to the main branch, and if it detects a change, it runs the rendering process and pushes the result to the gh-pages branch. This means that if I were to change the BibTeX file, it would trigger a re-render, and the list of publications would be automatically updated.\nThere are some tricks to keep in mind here. Most importantly, because this requires some custom Python packages, I had to slightly amend my Github publishing workflow:\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n    A[\"actions/checkout@v4\"] --&gt; B[\"quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2\"]\n    B --&gt; C[\"actions/setup-python@v4\"]\n    C --&gt; D(\"pip install -r requirements.txt\")\n    D --&gt; E[\"quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2\"]\n    style D stroke-width:8px;\n    style C stroke-width:8px;\n\n\nFigure 3: Integrating the pre-render script into the Github Actions CI/CD framework. The parts that need to be integrated into the publishing workflow are highlighted with bold outlines.\n\n\n\n\nIn particular, I had to explicitly specify the Python version and install the requirements. This is because the quarto-actions/setup action does not install the requirements, and the quarto-actions/publish action does not install Python. This is admittedly a bit of a nuisance to work around, but really not all that big a deal in the grand scheme of things.\nOne thing to keep in mind when writing your script is the context from which it will be executed. In particular, if you’re using a CI/CD pipeline, you will need to make sure that the script can find the files it needs. In my case, I had to explicitly specify the path to the BibTeX file, as well as the path to the output file. This is because the script is executed from the root of the repository, but the BibTeX file is in the papers directory, and the output file is in the papers directory, too. Testing locally for deployment in CI/CD is notoriously hellish, but with a little bit of elbow grease,2 you can get it to work.2 And by ‘a little bit’, I mean absolute tons of it.\nOne caveat: rendering with pre- and post-render project scripts may be relatively expensive in terms of time. My silly SkiErg world record script adds a good 20-25 seconds of processing time to each rendering run – not a lot, but it does stack up eventually. The documentation helpfully discloses that Quarto provides an environment variable, QUARTO_PROJECT_RENDER_ALL, which is set to 1 if it’s a full render. It may make sense to do a more manual caching here.\n\n\nThings you can do with project scripts\nSeriously, the possibilities of what you can do with project scripts are pretty much endless. I have a project script that checks the world records list on the official SkiErg website and makes sure my index page lists my accurate records. This is completely silly, but it’s also a great example of how you can use project scripts to automate just about everything:\n\nA lot of projects use it for housekeeping: via makefiles\nThe bambi project uses it to build a changelog, which is a great idea for applications that do need it\nThis one cool master’s thesis uses pre-render project scripts to load variables from a YAML file into envvars, and I’ve seen the same done with Rprofile files – obviously, these are much more pertinent to projects where the bulk of the project consists of notebooks/code execution rather than websites, but again, the idea is the same\nObviously, I’m not the only one to use it for reference management\nYou can use it to download static content into your project, too!\n\nThe sky’s the limit! I’m currently working on rendering my CV from a JSON file via a project script, as well as a few other cool things. I keep my project scripts here – I hope they will inspire you to do something cool with your own project scripts!\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@misc{csefalvay2023,\n  author = {Chris von Csefalvay},\n  title = {Quarto Project Scripts Are Awesomeness},\n  date = {2023-10-22},\n  url = {https://chrisvoncsefalvay.com/posts/quarto-project-scripts},\n  doi = {10.59350/b4qyq-70w75},\n  langid = {en-GB}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nChris von Csefalvay. 2023. “Quarto Project Scripts Are\nAwesomeness.” https://doi.org/10.59350/b4qyq-70w75."

There’s still pink in the sky over the Front Range, and most of the world is still blissfully asleep. And so far, a small, moderately fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) trained on $500 worth of free credits has explained to me just how bad the Broncos’ recent 20–70 embarrassment against the Miami Dolphins is (very), made some useful suggestions for a Caddoan language to learn if I wanted to help with language preservation (Pawnee) and created a fairly acceptable recipe to salvage whatever is left in my fridge (spicy tomato and cheese omelet with a chia side salad). Not too shabby for something that has absolutely no understanding of language preservation, omelets or American football (then again, neither do I, as far as the last one is concerned).\nAnd therein lies one of the pervasive paradoxes of LLMs: they generate very confident, very credible and very often correct answers to questions on subjects they really don’t know all that much about.\n\nRead the full post here.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{csefalvay2023,\n  author = {Chris von Csefalvay},\n  title = {The Knowledge Dividend of Large Language Models},\n  date = {2023-10-02},\n  url = {https://chrisvoncsefalvay.com/posts/knowledge-dividend-of-llms},\n  langid = {en-GB}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nChris von Csefalvay. 2023. “The Knowledge Dividend of Large\nLanguage Models.” October 2, 2023. https://chrisvoncsefalvay.com/posts/knowledge-dividend-of-llms."
