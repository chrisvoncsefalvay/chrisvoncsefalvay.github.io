It is relatively trivial to teach a computer to be relatively good at chess or checkers or even go. On the other hand, getting a computer to master, say, bipedal motion is actually very, very tricky. There are multiple reasons behind this, including that the human brain is the pinnacle of an evolutionary pathway that spans the course of millions of years of optimisation for certain kinds of tasks, such as bipedal motion. We are an ‘opinionated’ system: we evolved with the idea that we’ll be solving certain kinds of problems, and not others. The evolutionary incentive for chess has been relatively modest compared to the evolutionary incentive to be able to run away from a sabre tooth cat or some prehistoric predator. Our brains have evolved through millions of years of exposure to certain senses: vision, balance, proprioception, pressure/pain, and so on. Without so much as wasting a single thought, our brain performs the process of sensor fusion and generating an operating model of where we are in space with accuracy that is really not trivial for computers even today. And we’re really good at this before we’re old enough to know just what an amazing nervous system we have. You really do not realise what a fantastic thing the human central nervous system is until it starts malfunctioning.\n\nRead the full answer here."

    "text": "Will true AI come before the ability to completely simulate a human brain? Is there a difference?\n\nSimulating the human brain is a fairly pointless exercise. You see, the human brain is a functionally extremely diverse thing. You see this best when you consider what damage to it can cause: some brain injuries cause mood disorders, some cause memory disorders, some cause aphasia (speech disorders), some cause issues with mobility and motor control, some cause severe disorders of consciousness like persistent vegetative states and minimally conscious states. The brain is basically a bunch of histologically largely similar tissue that does a lot of different things. There’s not a lot of point in simulating these functions.\nA bigger problem, though, is that some things are a lot harder to ‘simulate’ than others. This is something widely known as Moravec’s paradox: it’s a lot easier to teach a computer to play chess at a pretty high level than to teach it simple bipedal human motion. For this reason, simulating the human brain has generally been seen as not all that much of a priority. Connectionism is great, but it’s largely an inspiration, not a one-to-one reality. Many get this wrong because of concepts like neural networks and artificial neurons. In reality, a neural network is an abstraction to help humans. On the code level, there aren’t individual neurons or layers, there is just a bunch of relatively trivial linear algebra going on. I know I’m oversimplifying a little, but that’s the general idea.\n\nRead the full answer here."

I live in Denver, a city with a major but not first-in-line international airport (e.g. not like Heathrow or LAX, but a pretty nice airport no less, despite the creepy murals). Just as a thought experiment, I sometimes pick random places on the planet and look at how long it would take me to get there. It’s virtually never more than 48 hours.\nTo prove this point: it’s a little before 8am on a Sunday here. I can be:\n…in Ürümqi, China, in about 35 hours, …in Makassar City, Sulawesi, Indonesia, in about 33 to 42 hours, …in Maputo, Mozambique, in about 29 to 35 hours, depending on airline, …in Itahanga, Mato Grosso, Brazil, in about 44 hours, if I drove straight from Manaus, or 34 hours if I flew into Brasilia.\nI do these thought experiments all the time when I wonder about the thing you’re asking yourself.

In fact, I’d be extremely surprised if that weren’t the case.\nLet me take a slight detour here to a concept that might be more familiar. You’ve heard of supershedding and superspreading, right? We’re instinctively geared to consider things like that to be extraordinary phenomena, the same way some people who could hold an HIV infection without developing AIDS were known as “elite controllers” for a long time (today, the term is “long-term non-progressor”, which is much less cool, sadly). But the reality is, they’re not. They’re the (often quite fat) tails of a distribution. Here’s something that doesn’t come to you naturally, something you need to force your brain to wrap itself around as you start doing epidemiology: all the numbers you encounter talk about the central tendency, but say relatively little about the distribution.\nLet me expand on that a little. What’s the mean infectious period of COVID-19? If you ask someone who has a relatively good grasp of the subject, they’ll say it’s around 9–10 days, with an interquartile range of around 4–12 days, give or take one day each way. That term – “interquartile range” – means that given a sample, half of the values will be in that range. Or, more importantly, half of the values will be outside that range.\n\nRead the full answer here."

    "text": "Native Americans were devastated by European diseases brought by colonizers, but were the colonialists impacted by new diseases not found in Europe?\n\nYes, with a significant difference: the Americas had a population density nowhere near that of urban Europe, where many of the colonists came from. Europe is tiny, and very interconnected. The result of that is that pathogenic diversity is going to be off the charts. It’s not even that Europeans brought various epidemics into the Americas, whose populations were largely naive to those pathogens (a phenomenon widely known as a ‘virgin soil epidemic’, much as I loathe the term) – it’s that they bought hundreds of different versions of it. They brought that into societies that, at least where North America was concerned, lived in a way that is very significantly more resilient to pathogens: in small(ish) groups, often as part of extended families (i.e. often similar profiles of immunity), spread out. In a profound sense, Old World epidemics are the result of a peculiarly (but not exclusively) Old World phenomenon: the Big City (“big”, here, being generally relative to total populations). When colonists moved to the Americas, they bought a piece of that Big City’s pathogenic diversity with them, to populations that have neither been exposed to that particular microbiome, nor have generally been under the evolutionary pressure to select for better genetic predispositions to develop immunity to a wide range of pathogens, since that just wasn’t much of a thing in the New World.\n\nRead the full answer here."

    "text": "The flu has been around since 1918. Why are the vaccines against Covid, which is much newer and more harmful, so much more effective than the flu vaccines? Is there any hope for a ‘universal flu vaccine’ (as there is for a ‘universal Covid vaccine’)?\n\nInfluenzaviruses have been around for much longer than since 1918. Greek physicians from the 5th century BC have documented what is almost definitely influenza. Influenza A and B viruses have differentiated around 2,000 years ago, but both trace their origins to a common ancestor around 8,000 years or so ago, give or take a few thousand years (molecular clocking gets tricky after some time). More importantly, however, influenza has a level of diversity that far exceeds SARS-CoV-2.\nInfluenzaviruses are actually not a single pathogen, but four genera of the family orthomyxoviridae, each of which comprises a single species: we refer to these as influenzaviruses A, B, C and D. These are viral species in their own right. A, B and C are human pathogenic, and A is responsible for pandemic influenza. Influenzaviruses then break down into serotypes. When you see something like H1N1, that’s a subtype – it denotes the type of two major surface proteins, haemagglutinin (the number after H) and neuraminidase (the number after N) expressed by the virion. Influenza A virus is incredibly genetically diverse, and mutates rapidly. This creates a kind of diversity and versatility that makes it hard to vaccinate against.\n\nRead the full answer here."

    "text": "Why are infectious diseases with high mortality rates not as infectious as those with lower mortality rates?\n\nThere’s a theory that underlies this observation, widely known as the ‘avirulence hypothesis’ aka ‘trade-off theory’ (which I discuss in my book on p.164). The idea is that from the perspective of the pathogen, virulence (the detrimental effect of the pathogen on the human) is quite epiphenomenal. The pathogen does not get an evolutionary advantage out of harming the host. Some of the most widely spread viruses, for instance, cause no symptoms at all in the overwhelming majority of people. My favourite, JC virus, is present in about 50–70% of all people worldwide, and generally does not cause symptoms unless the person in question is immunosuppressed (at which point, sadly, it can cause some dreadful consequences – progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, which occurs in HIV/AIDS and with the use of certain medications for neuroautoimmune disorders that reduce immune system activity in the brain, is caused by JC virus reactivation, and is pretty unpleasant). Ubiquitous viruses like EBV and some herpesviruses are generally very indolent, to the point of being asymptomatic in many cases. In some instances, they might even be beneficial – gammaherpesviruses are associated, at least in animal models, with an increased resistance to Y. pestis and Listeria monocytogenes.\n\nRead the full answer here.

And this is one of the bigger travesties of the world.\n\n\nUnfortunately, humans are what they are, and the two superpowers, the US and the USSR at the time, decided that each would be allowed to keep actual smallpox samples. The last outbreak of smallpox was not ‘natural’ but a laboratory escape, killing a medical photographer, Janet Parker, in 1978. In 1984, the WHO authorised two labs – VECTOR in Koltsovo, USSR, and the CDC in Atlanta – to store samples of it.

Equally, I used to think primarily in Hungarian as a child (the language we spoke at home most of the time), but increasingly found I had a hard time expressing certain ideas.

I can recognise it even if you speak it very faintly. I may not even be able to understand individual words, but there’s a ‘rhythm’ and ‘tonality’ to it that you can understand. The best analogy is this: say you’ve listened to your fair share of modern minimalist composers. If I gave you a new Philip Glass soundtrack, you’d immediately recognise it. There are some motifs that are just ‘so Glass’. This actually goes beyond identifying the language and starts to involve the semantic layer.

What can be done about this issue?\n\nI worked for a Big Law firm. To say we charged like doctors is a gross insult. Very few doctors charge remotely what we did.\nThere’s a quite simple reason for why that’s the case: spending seven figures (or more) with us could save a company from being sunk by a lawsuit. Think about that for a moment. We routinely acted in matters where tens or hundreds of millions were at stake, and often enough, much more. The amount of money at play in such high stakes matters is orders of magnitude beyond whatever impact an individual physician may generate. You don’t have to like this fact of life, but that doesn’t make it any less a fact of life.\n\nRead the full answer here."

    "text": "If the UK were invaded, would it be legal in UK law for a civilian to murder an enemy combatant if the opportunity presented itself?\n\nThe laws of war basically separate people in two classes – combatants and non-combatants. A combatant cannot be prosecuted for the lawful conduct of hostilities which, yes, involves killing the other side’s combatants (they can, however, be prosecuted for war crimes). They are entitled to the panoply of rights that combatants have upon becoming non-combatants by way of surrender or becoming hors de combat, such as being wounded. On the other hand, a combatant can generally be killed with pretty little justification – if the kill is legal (the person is a combatant at the time, and the kill did not involve perfidy or some other form of illegality), it is what it is.\nNon-combatants enjoy extensive privileges in contrast. Not only are they entitled to protection, even if they are living in occupied areas, they are also categorically not permissible targets for military action. They and their property enjoy extensive protections. They cannot generally be interned against their will unless they are prisoners of war, they cannot generally be forced to work and there are various other protections they enjoy. Most of all, they cannot be killed for no reason other than not liking the occupying power.\nThis gets complex where someone decides they’re going to blur the lines.\n\nRead the full answer here."

This is not, actually, a necessary implication. Constitutions can be superordinate norms and it makes sense for them to be so. On the other hand, they don’t have to, nor is it a necessary implication of a constitution that it should be a superordinate norm. Nor do written and codified constitutions exclude reliance on other norms that happen not to be written and codified. An example would be constitutional conventions, which are basically political customs – plenty of countries with proper, codified constitutions have them. For instance, Germany has a codified constitution (even if it is not called a constitution but a Basic Law, for historical reasons), but that doesn’t provide for who gets to nominate the President of the Bundestag in the circumstances where a party has a plurality but is in opposition. It turns out that in this case, it would still be the largest party that would get to provide the President of the Bundestag, i.e. there’s no horse-trading between coalition parties to have a joint candidate for President of the Bundestag.

    "text": "Don’t American law students study the famously unwritten British Constitution? Are the details superfluous?\n\nThe British constitution is very much written.* It’s not codified. There’s a difference. For instance, nobody would argue that the Human Rights Act 1998 isn’t part of the British constitutional order, and last I checked, it’s pretty darn written. What it isn’t is codified, meaning there isn’t a single constitutional document.\nPart of the reason for this is that we do not have coequal branches of government. The UK has legislative supremacy, i.e. Parliament is not fettered by the judiciary. There’s no such thing as judicial review of primary legislation (as opposed to secondary legislation aka statutory instruments, and administrative action) the way there is in the US post-Marbury v Madison. Therefore, there’s no real need — or use — for a superordinate norm against which legislation may be tested. John Griffith said “the constitution is what happens … if it works, it’s constitutional”. The lecture (and later article) in which he made this poignant remark was titled The Political Constitution, which I think is a great way of describing the UK’s constitutional order.\n\nRead the full answer here."

    "text": "Is law school intrinsically worth it? Even if you don’t become a lawyer, is it worth it to go through the process of law school?\n\nThe common perception is that law school is spent studying the law. This is maybe true in the vaguest outlines. Let me give you an example: like everyone pursuing a qualifying law degree in England and Wales, I had to take criminal law. Part of that was learning the elements of certain offences. I know to this date that theft is the (1) dishonest (2) appropriation of (3) property (4) belonging to another (5) with intent to permanently deprive. Would I actually know how to defend a theft charge? Probably not. How each of these parameters are applied in practice is not a lot like what you learn in law school.\nYou do, however, learn a lot about reasoning. For instance, ‘dishonesty’ is an element of the offence. In England and Wales, a finding of dishonesty requires both a subjective and objective element (R v Ghosh), i.e. not only does your action have to be something others would consider dishonest, but it must also be something you yourself would consider dishonest. How would one arrive at that finding? How would one make the pleading for that? Would, say, someone believing that they are enriching themselves unjustly qualify?\n\nRead the full answer here."

    "text": "Do mathematicians use advanced terminology?\n\nAs you move towards more advanced maths, it becomes less about dealing with numbers and stuff, and more about logical manipulations of various concepts. We want a convenient way to refer to certain things for which certain statements are true. To give you an example you are likely familiar with: we could say “x is a member of the set of integers greater than one that is not the product of two natural numbers”. Or, we could just say “x is [a] prime”. This is useful when you have to describe more complex things. A group, for instance, is a construct that consists of a set and an operation. A set and an operation are a group if they exhibit the group axioms — properties that are the “requirements” for a group. What these are are not so relevant here as the fact that life is a whole lot easier for us if we can simply say “group” and know that everyone else will know what we’re talking about, including, importantly, what specific features this thing we allege is a group would exhibit, from which we can then derive various other properties. For instance, one property of a group is that the operation is “closed”, meaning that performing the operation on any elements of the set will give you another element of the set. We know that addition of integers is a group (the set is the set of integers, the operation is addition). Consequently, we have proved that if x and y are integers, so will x + y be an integer. Trivial, yes, but it gets much more complicated quite quickly.\nMany of these concepts are, essentially, sets of rules and conditions. Often, they’re subspecies: an Abelian group is a group that satisfies some specific criteria. A ring is a kind of Abelian group that meets some additional criteria. And so on. Mathematical terminology is intended to capture these logical distinctions in a sort of shorthand.\n\nRead the full answer here."

The problem is that the brain does not have a lot of tolerance for swelling, and therefore pretty much any inflammation in the brain is going to be a massive problem.\nThe reason why PAM is the worst kind of meningoencephalitis is because the pathogen involved, N. fowlerii, is extremely difficult to kill. Naegleriasis is an amoebiasis rather than a bacterial infection, meaning that the usual method of solving problems – throw antibiotics at it – doesn’t really work. The most effective drug until recently used to be amphotericin B, which is notorious enough for its side effect profile to be nicknamed ‘amphoterrible’.

It’s not the most unpleasant drug in the infectious disease arsenal, because our friends in Infectious Diseases have things like literal arsenic in antifreeze (melarsoprol), but it’s pretty bad. And that’s before dealing with the problem of actually getting it to the site of the action, which often requires intrathecal administration (into the spinal canal), which has an entire set of issues on its own.

The idea of a PET scan is something along these lines: a radiotracer that undergoes ß+ decay is injected, and accumulates where the tracer is taken up (this depends on the tracer and the physiology being imaged). As the tracer undergoes ß+ decay, it emits positrons (thence the PE – ‘positron emission’ – part of the name). When positrons hit electrons, they annihilate and emit a gamma photon. This is then imaged using a gamma camera, which basically measures the intensity of light,* in this case, gamma light. The result is a picture of how much gamma light is emitted from any point in space, thanks to a nifty little thing called an inverse Radon transform (that’s ruh-DOWN as opposed to ray-DOWN, which is how you are supposed to pronounce the element, to which it’s entirely unrelated).\nNow, I’ve gone through this length to explain how the image is acquired because it helps us understand what the image is (which is always something you should have at the forefront in medical imaging). It’s an image of signal intensity attributable to a point in three-dimensional space (although we obviously look at 2-dimensional projections of it), where that signal intensity is the measure of the amount of ß+ decay originating from that point, which in turn is a measure of how much of the tracer is taken up by tissue at that point, which in turn is biologically meaningful (e.g. if the tracer is 18fluoro-deoxyglucose, which is a radiotagged sugar, it will show areas of higher glucose metabolism). In other words, for any point in space (and therefore, for any projection thereof), we have one value for any point in space.\n\nRead the full answer here."

    "text": "What would happen to your body if you’re exposed to 10 times the magnetic power (30T) of an MRI scanner?\n\nMost of the weird and/or unpleasant things that tend to happen in a properly operated MRI (by which I mean nobody is letting the guy with all the spinal hardware into the scanner room) don’t actually happen due to the static magnetic field. In MRIspeak, that’s normally denoted \\(B_0\\). If you read MRI safety literature, you’ll see another symbol a whole lot more: \\(\\frac{dB}{dt}\\), known to its friends and relatives as “flux change”. In this case, \\(dB\\) stands not for decibels but is rather the change in the total field strength. It turns out that if you have a high frequency of change (and as we know, frequency is the inverse of the period), then even relatively small fields can build up quite a bit of flux change. The MRI has a part called the RF transmit coil (or sometimes just “coil”) that transmits a much, much smaller magnetic field that, however, varies rapidly. It’s called an RF coil because the transmitted signal is in the radiofrequency range, so in the high hundreds to low thousands of MHz (megahertz). If you get a tiny field that flips a hundred million times a second, you’re going to get an awful lot of flux change. By far the biggest problem is that this field coexists, regrettably, with an electric field \\(E\\) (we’ve got Maxwell to thank for that). The Maxwell equation, of course, tells us that \\(\\del \\times E = \\frac{dB}{dt}\\), which in short means that if you oscillate the magnetic field, you’re going to get an electric field perpendicular to the magnetic field lines that is going to oscillate at the same frequency. This electric field dumps energy into whatever is at hand, and if you’re in the Magic Donut, that energy will end up in you. There are largely two things that happen. One is the result of the fact that you’re only seventy-odd percent water. A good part of the rest are charged particles, which are accelerated by this field and slammed into the nearest water molecule. This creates vibrational energy, which is also known as heat. This is called Ohmic heating, and if you’ve ever had one of those old space heaters that were ridiculously unsafe but incredibly cosy after being drenched by the rain, that’s how they worked. The bigger issue is dielectric heating. If you vary the electric field fast enough, all sorts of polar molecules are going to try to align themselves with that field. Unfortunately, that seventy-odd percent of yours that is water? That’s a polar molecule. If you flip water molecules around their axis a couple of hundred million tiems a second, you get what everyone else knows and loves as a “microwave oven”. Higher field strengths involve higher RF frequencies (for reasons you might find out by googling Larmor frequencies), so the RF coils in a higher field will have a higher \\(\\frac{dB}{dt}\\) and hence a higher \\(\\frac{dE}{dt}\\). That in turns means more energy dumped as heat. It’s worth noting that this energy dumping as heat is pretty minimal. What happens a lot more often is if there’s something to be heated. There are two flavours of this. One is what we call inductive heating. This happens when the body, which is an okayish conductor, comes in touch with something that isn’t, such as the bore. That generates a resistance, and we know what happens to resistances. The other alternative is anything that creates a loop. By far the most frequent loops that generate RF burns are humans. If you are raising your arms up, don’t touch them. If you’re holding your arms down, don’t touch your hip. Don’t let cables touch your abdomen. More importantly, don’t let coils of cables be anywhere near you.\n\nRead the full answer here."

Britain owned Australia in the past so surely Britain can do whatever it wants in Australia?\n\nIn 1907, at the Imperial Conference, a number of self-governing British territories, such as Australia and Canada, became dominions. This made them subjects capable of independent standing under international law – Australia, for example, was one of the founding nations of the League of Nations. In 1931, the Statute of Westminster further increased the sovereignty of dominions. This basically put into effect the Balfour Declaration of 1926, which declared that the dominions were co-equal with each other and the United Kingdom. It also, implicitly, repealed the Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865 and essentially terminated the ability of Westminster to legislate for the Dominions. By the time you’re referring to, Australia has very much been an independent sovereign that in no conceivable way was “owned” by Britain. This includes participation in collective security agreements the UK was not party to, such as Australia and New Zealand’s alliance with the US – and, of course, it participated in the UN as a fully-fledged sovereign.\n\nRead the full answer here."

The purpose of that was to watch for indicators of what in British governmentese is called ‘transition to war’ (TTW). The later Soviet leader, Yuri Andropov, was then the head of the KGB. Even by the standards of KGB functionaries, Andropov was paranoid to a clinical degree, at least partly due to his brain swimming in an increasingly potent pickle of his body’s own waste products due to untreated renal failure. More so, though, he witnessed a bunch of Soviet-trained servants of the Communist repression in Hungary get hung from lampposts during the 1956 Revolution, which left him with a life-long ‘Hungarian Complex’. Andropov genuinely believed that the West, with Reagan’s encouragement, was going to get the drop on the Soviet Union.\n\nRead the full answer here."

Is it that simple to construct a dirty bomb if compared to the “standard” nukes used by countries?\n\nThe entire edifice of control over the nuclear means of our fellow man’s destruction rests on a very simple principle: nuclear weapons need fissile material. It’s impossible to get fissile material easily (you can technically go and buy small amounts, but even that’s tricky). It’s impossible to make fissile material easily – you’ll have to master an entire industry called uranium enrichment or a different one called plutonium breeding. And there’s a minimum of how much fissile material you need to realise a yield. The ‘critical’ in ‘critical mass’ reflects this: critical mass plus one gram equals nuclear boom, critical mass minus one gram equals no nuclear boom. The effect of this scheme is that as long as nobody sells fissile material, even relatively well-funded state actors – think Iran, North Korea – have an enormously difficult time getting enough fissile material to play the nuclear game. Non-state actors pretty much stand not a snowball’s chance in hell.\n\nRead the full answer here."

It’s British(-made) food, so take that with a pinch of salt (literally – it will taste super salty, but actually be devoid of actual salt, because the government replaced all salt with potassium chloride). Food at Formal Hall is generally very nice, food at lunch and informal hall ranges from good-quality institutional food to quite nice, actually. The typical staples are the usual English breakfast (baked beans, sausages, bacon, you get where I’m headed), whatever can be made at institutional scale for lunch, and the same again for dinner. If you go to informal hall every day for three meals at the same college, you will very rapidly grow bored of it. It’s not necessarily unhealthy, and it’s quite affordable, but it ain’t Heston Blumenthal. The same bubble & squeak will get a little dull after you’ve had it for the fifth time that term.

We all have good days and bad days, but you absolutely cannot have a bad finals week.

The number would probably be, if I counted everyone alive and assumed that there are the same number of equivalents from the Other Place, in the three digits, and that’s assuming every year’s top 1st in every subject did at least as well as I did or better. Off a sample of eight billion, that’s a pretty low number.

Some have top degrees from other universities. Some don’t have any degrees at all, or yet. Some could never get into Oxford and many, if they did, might not do well. There are many things involved in getting in, and doing well at, Oxford. Intelligence is at best part of the story. If I had a limited number of skill points to put into various skills to ensure success at Oxford, intelligence wouldn’t be my first or even second choice. More has been determined by industry, hard work and sheer bloody-minded determination than intelligence.

It’s a common misunderstanding that money can’t buy time. That’s only the case if you manage it badly. If you can accrue money faster than what it costs you to buy an hour of your time, then this is absolutely no issue. 90% of what you do in your waking hours are things you can make someone else do, and usually for pretty nominal cash. I think there’s something good about doing many of these activities yourself – for instance, I’d never hire a personal chef, as making food relaxes me and it’s a good way to keep whatever motor function I’ve got left in my hands mostly in practice. On the other hand, I hate doing the dishes, and if I had to fly to Sotheby’s in London to bid on the last dishwasher in existence, I’d raid my savings to make sure to get it. There are very few things money cannot buy (love, loyalty, friendship are some examples). For all else, you just need to know how to spend your money to buy what it is you really want. If there’s one thing I’ve seen affluent people spend differently on, it’s that vastly more of their spend goes towards things that either buy them time, or buy them experiences to fill that time with.\nAnd that’s pretty close to happiness.\n\nRead the full answer here."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Over at the work blog, I’m discussing what knowledge means for large language models (LLMs), and the ways in which we can leverage this knowledge dividend for better inference.\n\nLanguage is highly semantic, but because of that, it is also highly flexible. By semantic, I mean that every lexeme has a distinct and coherent meaning. A lexeme is the “root form” that is conjugated to various forms, e.g. “see”, “saw” or “seeing” are all forms of the same lexeme, “SEE” (by convention, in linguistics, we set lexemes in capitals to distinguish them of their homomorphic conjugated forms). By flexibility, I mean that you can actually manipulate lexical order and retain meaning. Consider the sentence “Joe walked his dog in the park”. “In the park, Joe walked his dog” and “His dog, Joe walked in the park” all have slightly different nuances due to inflection and emphasis of order, but overall, they all get the same larger message across. Some languages permit even more flexibility with word order, but even in English, the worst case scenario is that it’ll sound a little odd. The content remains intelligible, which is why poets get to move words around to make things rhyme. In short, producing something that looks “like” natural language is going to be natural language. It’s likely not going to be a Booker Prize-winning product of staggering genius, but it will be good enough.\nThis is not the case for asemantic structures. By asemantic structures, I mean any system in which a sequence of tokens has a meaning, but in which there’s no semantic meaning to any token. In other words, every token has a meaning, but that meaning is not inherent in their character. It probably serves to belabour this point a little. All words are, to an extent, made up, but more similar words are closer to each other in meaning. By similar, I do not mean simple formal similarity, such as Hamming or Levenshtein distances, but rather logical similarity, e.g. conjugation of the same root. This is more evident in some languages than others. In Semitic languages, for instance, you have clusters of meaning that are connected by consonantal roots. By way of an example: the triconsonantal root k-b-d connects a cloud of meanings that all have to do with the middle or centre of something, and by extension the centre of gravity or honour. This gives us e.g., the Hebrew words for ‘heavy’ (כָּבֵד), mass in the physical sense (כֹּבֶד), and the word for ‘liver’ (כָּבֵד), which was considered to be roughly in the middle of the body. In any language, however, there is a degree of meaningful semantic similarity between connected concepts. There has more been written on this than I have the space to mention here.\nAn asemantic structure is where there are formally similar things that are unrelated. You have probably experienced this when you dialled the wrong number by a slip of the finger. The fact is, if you live in the United States, my phone number looks a lot like yours, and by extension, anyone else’s. There’s no semantically meaningful reason why your phone number shouldn’t be mine or vice versa: it’s not more ‘you’ as mine is not more ‘me’ in any underlying sense.\nWhich is why GPT-4 struggles with asemantic content, and we’ll use this to break it a little.\n\nRead the full post here.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{csefalvay2023,\n  author = {Chris von Csefalvay},\n  title = {Asemantic {Induction} of {Hallucinations} in {LLMs}},\n  date = {2023-03-23},\n  url = {https://chrisvoncsefalvay.com/posts/asemantic-induction-of-hallucinations},\n  langid = {en-GB}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nChris von Csefalvay. 2023. “Asemantic Induction of Hallucinations\nin LLMs.” March 23, 2023. https://chrisvoncsefalvay.com/posts/asemantic-induction-of-hallucinations."

Sneaking off to the Wallace Collection in London and just looking at the Dance was my comfort activity while living in London – a time that was not exactly devoid of its trials. It’s not, by any measure, great art, insofar as such judgments can be made with any objectivity. Like most French Baroque allegorical paintings, it’s considered somewhat ‘boring’. It neither has, nor claims to arrogate to itself, the fiery passion of a Van Gogh, the compositional genius of a Vermeer or the turbulence of a Turner. It’s not particularly well known, and indeed more know it for having lent its name to Anthony Powell’s dodecalogy (quite incidentally, another of my favourite works of art). In as far as there can be a sensible debate as to what is, and isn’t, ‘good’ or ‘great’ art, few would consider Dance to fall into that category. What nobody would argue, however, is that it is a piece of art.\nWhat, then, if I gave a somewhat clumsy description of the scene to Stable Diffusion, the currently fashionable model of generating images? Let’s try this:\nHere’s what I got:\nIt’s not great by any stretch of the word. The faces, like in most diffusion models, are a mess.

Notably, those mature enough to reach a non-professional audience – ChatGPT based on GPT-3 and later GPT-4 – came quite some time after models that could create fairly acceptable visual ‘art’.1 The appearance of synthetic language-like products (SLLPs), as I like to call the output of such generative models, came well after the appearance of synthetic simulacra of visual art,2 yet elicited much less fervent responses.\nThis was quite striking, for three reasons.\nWhich, of course, leads us to the key question: what if we got one of the most deeply enshrined beliefs about language, intelligence and the relationship between the two utterly, dreadfully wrong?"

    "section": "",
    "text": "In a recent paper that has attracted the interest of popular media as well, Fabio Urbina and colleagues examined the use (or rather, the abuse) of computational chemistry models of toxicity for generating toxic compounds and potential chemical agent candidates.(Urbina et al. 2022) Urbina and colleagues conclude that\n\nBy going as close as we dared, we have still crossed a grey moral boundary, demonstrating that it is possible to design virtual potential toxic molecules without much in the way of effort, time or computational resources.\n\nI agree with the conclusion, but for rather different reasons.\n\nBackground\nComputational chemistry is the branch of computational science that focuses on applications in the chemical field. This includes pharmacology and rational drug design (RDD) in particular. The purpose of RDD is to generate drug candidates that show favourable indicators of effectiveness (such as high binding affinity to a target protein) along with indicators of biological suitability (such as no or low interference with other proteins, low toxicity and no inhibition of metabolic ‘bottlenecks’ like CYP3A4). The latter part is typically handled by a toxicity model.\nRather simply put, a toxicity model infers the structural associations (the chemical structures associated with undesirable effects) from a library of known compounds with known effects. For instance, the Toxicology in the 21st Century (Tox21) programme of the US federal government has performed over sixty different assays (typically, enzyme inhibition assays) for over 13,000 different compounds. (Tice et al. 2013) Using molecular fingerprinting, which we have discussed in a previous post on this blog in this very same context, it is possible to build relatively easy models for toxicity. Where a particular desired toxicity is known, say mitochondrial toxicity, it’s not difficult to build a pipeline that generates candidate compounds, derives the molecular fingerprint and evaluates the likelihood that the molecule that is obtained will be an effective agent. In this sense, I wholeheartedly agree with Urbina: the cat is very much out of the bag. Even if Tox21’s public data does not include the classical target of modern chemical weapons (acetylcholinesterase), such data is not exactly hard to come by or, for a nation-state actor, to generate. A near-peer adversary could create such assays for cents on the compound.\nNothing about the above is controversial. In fact, Urbina’s paper is an example of ‘trivial genius’: just about anyone who has ever done computational chemistry in the pharmacological/drug design space knows that any algorithm that is intended to optimise towards lower toxicity can be inverted to optimise towards higher toxicity, and the same models used to create effective enzyme inhibitors to treat cancer, depression, schizophrenia, allergies or autoimmune disease can be repurposed in a few hours and about $100 in AWS credits to something that will generate potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs). Notably, this is not to say that all research aimed at acetylcholinesterase inhibition is aimed at creating a chemical warfare agent. AChEIs are used in a clinical context, e.g. for myasthenia gravis. They are, however, also the archetypal “nerve agent”. Which leads me to my second point of agreement with Urbina et al.: the tools of computational pharmacology and RDD are — and have been, for a long time! — open to misuse.\n\n\nThe reverse of the medal\nOn the other hand, the likelihood of an AI-generated chemical agent ever posing a threat beyond the theoretical is very, very low. There are a few reasons for that, and they’re inherent partly in computational chemistry, partly in weapons design.\nThe computational chemistry part pertains to the fact that molecular fingerprinting and similar models only give us a narrow view of the outcomes we may expect. For starters, no model is able to reliably assess the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of synthesis. There are plenty of drug candidates that have performed admirably in vitro and sometimes even in clinical trials, but for which no feasible way of cost-efficient, large-scale synthesis could be found. Then, there are the drugs that ought to work, and might even work in vitro, but end up failing in clinical trials with no effect or an unexpected toxicity. Effect inference from chemical structure looks only at one side of the medal, and not even all of that.\nThe bigger problem is the weapons design part. To avoid a late-night visit from some mild-mannered federal employees in a dark SUV, I’d like to point out that anything I discuss here is well in the public domain. With that said: just as pharmaceutical chemists want some things from their target compounds (such as relatively little inference, predictable metabolism, a wide therapeutic margin and few adverse effects), designers of chemical weapons have their own considerations for which to optimise. VX, for instance, is immensely popular because its oily consistency gives it beneficial physical properties. Similarly, a potential chemical weapon candidate must be stable vis-a-vis e.g. UV exposure, but not too stable. An example of the latter is the Red Zone in France, the World War I battlefields that have been bombarded with so many chemical weapons that to this day, they are heavily contaminated by arsenic, among others. The preference for binary agents (which contain two relatively stable and relatively non-toxic chemicals that are mixed, typically during the flight time of a shell, to form the active agent) means that a less toxic agent that can be reliably produced from the simple admixture of two relatively stable agents may be preferred to a more lethal unary agent. And this, of course, all assumes a state actor willing and able to violate international law on chemical weapons.\nFinally, there is no real need for novel chemical agents, at least not in the nerve agent category. Not only does using a known agent provide plausible deniability, there is also no real need to create anything more lethal than VX. Even relatively old chemical agents, such as mustard agents, are effective enough. A novel chemical structure may not guarantee that the agent escapes chemical detection, and functional antidotes are going to be just as effective against novel agents. To an atropine/pralidoxime NAAK autoinjector’s efficacy, it makes no difference whether the acetylcholinesterase inhibition comes from sarin, VX, Tetram or inadvertent exposure to organophosphate pesticides. Arguably, this becomes somewhat more complex with other agents, where the biological targets — and hence the antidotes — are more specific. Nevertheless, it is hard to conceive of anyone possessed of a burning rationale to start creating novel chemical agents.\n\n\nA lighter shade of grey\nI commend the authors for discussing the moral aspects of this exercise. It is rather uncomfortable to write about the use of artificial intelligence to create tools whose predominant use would be to extinguish human lives (although, as noted, many of these compounds can, and often do, have a medicinal use).\nWhere I cannot agree with the authors is the conclusion that this situation calls for regulation (be it self-regulation or imposed from above).\n\nAlthough MegaSyn is a commercial product and thus we have control over who has access to it, going forward, we will implement restrictions or an API for any forward-facing models. A reporting structure or hotline to authorities, for use if there is a lapse or if we become aware of anyone working on developing toxic molecules for non-therapeutic uses, may also be valuable. Finally, universities should redouble their efforts toward the ethical training of science students and broaden the scope to other disciplines, and particularly to computing students, so that they are aware of the potential for misuse of AI from an early stage of their career, as well as understanding the potential for broader impact.\n\nThis is all well and good, but — assuming that there were a realistic danger of people coming to grief from AI-generated chemical weapons — it solves a problem that the authors have failed to substantiate exists. The tools to do this have been around for a long time. For the reasons laid out in the previous section, there is no burning desire anywhere in the world right now, as far as I can see, to develop a successor to VX purely on a structural basis. Of course, a chemical agent that can be synthesised without relying on any OPCW listed substances, or which can have novel effects, or which can escape traditional methods of detection (GC/MS, typically), would be of interest to potential bad actors, but current models of computational chemistry do not help with that. Creating permutational or functional analogues of VX does not, realistically, put anyone a single step closer to the ability to carry out an atrocity using such reprehensible weapons.\nOn the other hand, I am concerned about the moral aspects that derive from the consequences of Urbina et al.’s paper. Given that the overwhelming majority of users of computational chemistry and RDD do so for benign purposes, the public attention garnered by such articles may create a regulatory push that is not going to make anyone safer, but will impede scientific inquiry. Urbina et al. point out the reputational risk, and the risk of a single bad apple spoiling the lot — I am rather uncertain whether an attention-grabbing headline in The Verge, raising the spectre of the scary AI that generates tens of thousands of killer compounds in hours (virtually all of which are very likely to be practically useless), is doing our discipline any favours.\nThe Scythian prince Anacharsis likened laws to cobwebs: strong enough to catch the weak, but too weak to impede the powerful. In that sense, a sufficiently determined adversary with the right tools — scientists, labs, an AWS account with a few hundred bucks of credit — will be able to subvert the art of creating chemistry to save lives and turn it into a way to destroy them. No amount of regulation, controlled APIs and lectures on the Hague Ethical Guidelines are going to be any impediment. To a near-peer adversary or even a well-funded non-state actor, the door has been open for rational chemical agent discovery (RCAD) for a very long time. If the past is anything to go by, it has not really yielded rich fruit. Pretty much the only new thing under the sun for chemical agents in recent decades was the (possible, theorised) use of binary agents on Kim Jong-nam — not exactly a result of assiduous, AI-driven research into novel agents, but rather the every-day fare of a paranoid, despotic regime driven by cruelty and ignorance.\nThe only thing to fear, then, is fear itself. There is a justified concern in the AI community that while we do indeed need to discuss ethical use of artificial intelligence in the RDD domain, there is a time and a place for that. Sensationalism and alarmist headlines of poison-spewing machine learning models are great clickbait, but they do not benefit the discipline. Realism, not alarmism, is needed to tackle these issues.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nTice, Raymond R, Christopher P Austin, Robert J Kavlock, and John R Bucher. 2013. ‘Improving the Human Hazard Characterization of Chemicals: A Tox21 Update’.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Yesterday, I completed a marathon on the SkiErg, with a pretty respectable time (see results here). I know I can do better, and I know I will do better. On the other hand, this was a marathon where I pretty much did everything wrong. And that was sort of an instructive experience in its own right.\nThe title is somewhat misleading. Not much went wrong – the marathon itself was smooth sailing. At a 2:34.6 pace (min/500m), it was one of my better very long distance pieces – my ranked half-marathon pace at the time was 2:30.7, and that was a very intentional, very prepared piece. There were also really no unexpected surprises in the process. On the other hand, I built up to this marathon the in worst way possible.\n\nWhat worked for me\nIt’s probably important to be realistic ahead of all: I did go into this madness with some assets.\n\nFor one, I’m a multiple world record holder in my adaptive class. I know a thing or three about the SkiErg, and as a former rower, I’ve got every rower’s love-hate relationship with the erg.\nI’m a former multisport athlete, and I’ve been doing a lot of long distance pieces. I know how to cope with the boredom. Most people who go into a marathon have done a half, and maybe a 30k piece. I’ve done several split marathons in the past few weeks, as well as several 30k pieces.\nI’m probably in a pretty good state of overall fitness. I have enough of a gym habit to qualify as not exactly a couch potato. There’s a lot you can get away with if you have a decent \\(VO_{2_{max}}\\), and even though I’m in a wheelchair, I do enough activity to stay in good enough cardiovascular fitness.\nI have an incredible boredom tolerance. Marathons are primarily psychological: we’re just not used to doing the same one thing, without interruption, for 3-5 hours anymore.\nI guess insofar as there’s such a thing as a genetic predisposition to be good at long distance physical activity, I’ve got the right genes. My dad is a multi-marathon athlete, so I likely have the right physiology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Stroke level data for the SkiErg marathon.\n\n\n\n\nSource: skierg-marathon.ipynb\n\n\nHow not to do a marathon\nThere are generally three commonly accepted things to do for a good long distance piece:\n\nget some rest,\ncarb load, and\nif you’re not doing an organised race, have someone check in on you and help with things like hydration.\n\nI’ve done exactly zero of these things. For starters, I did my marathon in the middle of 75 Hard, which in retrospect was not the best of ideas, as it meant that (1) I wouldn’t be able to take days off to rest, and (2) I wouldn’t be able to carb load as that would be outside my diet. I’ve also decided to do all this while my better half was away visiting family, so I was pretty much on my own.\nAt 2am.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Stroke level data of stroke length (metres) versus stroke duration (seconds).\n\n\n\n\nSource: skierg-marathon.ipynb\nYes, that’s not a joke – I decided to do my marathon at a time when the world is falling apart at the seams, and so the only time I could find during which I could hope not to be interrupted with the latest crisis was late at night. So I woke up at 0130 hours, much to my dog’s chagrin, and headed down to my apartment building’s gym to torture myself for a few hours before the sun came up. Fortunately, the world decided to behave for those three and a half hours.\nI tried to counteract this to some extent by doing something I generally dislike: carbohydrate gels. A long, long time ago, in a galaxy far away, I ran the Watford half-marathon when I was still into actually running (by far the only reason I remember where that half-marathon was is because it was so miserable). It was a bitter cold day, and it actually started snowing in the middle of the damn thing. To keep myself mostly sane and nourished, I took some of these 100kcal sachets of carbohydrate gel. What I didn’t know, of course, was that that stuff would glue your mouth together unless you consumed enough water… which I didn’t. Bad idea. On the other hand, I am now older, wiser and able to afford much better and less sticky-tastic carbohydrate gels, so I thought I was going to have some. I didn’t feel much of an effect one way or the other. At one 100kcal sachet for every hour, I paced it a little slower than is commonly recommended (one sachet per every 45 minutes seems to be the consensus recommendation), but really didn’t feel much of an effect either way. In retrospect, I probably wouldn’t bother doing it again.\nAs for rest, the best I could do is not do a long distance piece the day before the marathon. Indeed, I only did a relaxing 2k that day, which is about a fifth of my average daily SkiErg distance. Nevertheless, I think it was quite clear that with my ultra-low-carb diet, no carb loading and at best minimal replenishment (my average burn rate was around 5-600kcal/hr, and I took in 100kcal via the carbohydrate gels, so pretty much a drop in the ocean), I was running on fumes for most of it.\n\n\n\nIncidentally, my marathon time is also the SIT2 world record for my age group.\n\n\n\n\nTakeaways\nMy key takeaway from this experience was that we all should do a marathon under suboptimal conditions. Yes, doing a long distance piece at Bataan death march levels of calorie deficit is probably not super healthy, but you learn some interesting things about your body in the process. For starters, I think it was an interesting illustration of the fact that one’s overall level of fitness – especially \\(VO_{2_{max}}\\) – matters a lot more than game day conditions. You can get away with a lot if you’re fit enough, up to and including running the show in quite sub-optimal circumstances.\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@misc{csefalvay2023,\n  author = {Chris von Csefalvay},\n  title = {How to Do a {SkiErg} Marathon Entirely the Wrong Way (but\n    Still Finish)},\n  date = {2023-10-13},\n  url = {https://chrisvoncsefalvay.com/posts/skierg-marathon},\n  doi = {10.59350/68s7b-8c778},\n  langid = {en-GB}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nChris von Csefalvay. 2023. “How to Do a SkiErg Marathon Entirely\nthe Wrong Way (but Still Finish).” https://doi.org/10.59350/68s7b-8c778."

In the latter, I currently hold the world records for 100m, 500m, 2,000m, 6,000m, 21,097m and 42,195m distances and the 60 minutes time. I occasionally rant and whine about my forays in the world of adaptive exercise and my attempts at doing so in a mostly science-based manner."

    "text": "I am a visiting thesis supervisor for students on the data science track of the mathematics programme at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. If you’re intending to write your thesis on a topic related to my research interests, you’re probably in the right place.\n\nProcedural aspects\nEach year, the department publishes a list of thesis topics. You can find the list for the current academic year. If you’re interested in one of the topics, you should contact the supervisor listed for that topic. If you’re interested in one of my topics, you should contact me.\nAs I am not full-time faculty, you will need to find an internal supervisor as well. The department has been very supportive of my students in the past, so this should not be a problem.\nWhile not a strict requirement, I would be very grateful if students aspiring to work with me could please make themselves known a few months before start of term. This will allow me to plan my time better, and to make sure that I can give you the attention you deserve.\n\n\nExpectations\nYou will generally be expected to create quality research-backed work based on the topic you choose. This means that you will need to read and understand the relevant literature, and you will need to be able to implement the algorithms you study. You will also need to be able to evaluate your work, and to compare it to existing methods. In short, you will need:\n\na good lit review,\na well-identified research gap,\na decent treatment of the latter, and\nall of this done in a sound, scientific and reproducible manner.\n\nThe expectation is that you will do the bulk of the work over a period of 6 months, and that you will be able to write up your results in a thesis of 40-60 pages. You will also be expected to present your work at a thesis defence.\nStudents may, at present, write their theses in English or in Hungarian. I have no preference for either, but I do expect that you will be able to write well in whichever language you choose. The lingua franca of data science, at the moment, is English, so if you’re planning to work in the field, you should probably be able to write in English. If you’re looking for employment abroad, a thesis in English will carry you a long way.\n\n\nTopics\nPast topics have included agent-based models of infectious diseases, disproportionality analyses of vaccination, computer vision on Synthetic Aperature Radar images for forest cover detection, and much more.\nEvery year I offer four topics for no more than two places. Of these, three tend to come from the biomedical domain, and at least one has some computer vision aspect. The topics are usually related to my research interests, and are usually related to my key research interests.\n\n\nTechnology\nAs far as I’m concerned, you can write your thesis using whatever widely used software you prefer. Obviously, writing your models in an esoteric language like Befunge or Malbolge will not endear you to the faculty, but within reason, you’re fine. Python by far is the most popular choice among my students.\nRemember that whatever topic you pick, you’re responsible for doing the work. This means that you will have to figure out how to cover costs of computation if these are non-trivial. The faculty may be able to help, as could I, but you should not expect this. This is particularly relevant for LLM related topics or where there are data access costs."

    "section": "",
    "text": "A little over half a decade ago, I came across a wonderful project: a programming language called Julia that was going to revolutionise data science and technical computing. It was going to run like C, seamlessly integrate with Fortran, do things R does without its clunkiness, look and read like Python and be homoiconic like Lisp. We were all going to heaven, and that right soon. The language wars would end, we would finally get a lingua franca for anywhere code performance mattered, Julia would take over the TIOBE Index, and we’d all be home for tea and medals.\nI was so enthusiastic, I learned all there was to learn about Julia, and even pitched a book to Manning, who graciously accepted Learn Julia into their Early Access programme. Interest was lukewarm at best, which should have been a warning sign. Eventually, Manning felt there would not be a sufficient market for the book – and I don’t blame them. Much of the book’s contents are now available on Github, and are a pretty good introduction for getting into the language.\nFast forward to 2020: Julia is currently on the 34th position (narrowly missing the first tercile) on the TIOBE ratings. More people use FoxPro, a database language that reached end-of-life almost fifteen years ago, than Julia. Vastly more people use Scratch, a language that for all intents and purposes is a ‘learning’ language. Almost twice as many developers use COBOL and Fortran as use Julia, and both of those languages are nearing the retirement age in most Western countries.\nSomething has clearly gone wrong. While Julia is not dead, and there are some very committed developers who expand the ecosystem, it is clear that the initial promise of Julia is unlikely to be realised. Instead of becoming the language, it will become just another language. Here are my thoughts why that’s the case."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In my latest post for the Starschema blog, I discuss the end of dashboards, and what comes next:\n\nEnterprises have spent the last two decades meticulously curating dashboards. Tools have improved and what once was the preserve of trained professionals has largely been democratized across the enterprise. However, dashboards are quintessentially static. A dashboard shows what its developer has directed it to show. That ignores the vast realm of the ‘unknown unknown’ that is, what we don’t know that we don’t know.\nDashboards, in that sense, answer narrow questions while giving the illusion of comprehensiveness and a 30,000ft perspective. In reality, dashboards are limited tools to convey limited information, while providing a psychologically fulfilling yet false illusion of comprehensiveness.\nThis may be true, but until now, there have been rather few alternatives. In the modern enterprise, a dashboard is created to provide a consumer with information on a particular subject. This involves certain judgments about what is, and what is not, included. This, in turn, biases the observer to what they are presented: they are, in a sense, trapped in an involuntary version of McNamara’s fallacy. What is not quantified and dashboarded does not exist. Few modern executives have the capability to reach beyond these summaries of data (if they did, they wouldn’t need dashboards in the first place).\nHowever, machine learning may spell a fundamental change in this. We now have the tools and techniques to sift through vast volumes of data and evaluate the relative saliency of each data item.\n\nRead the full post here.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{csefalvay2022,\n  author = {Chris von Csefalvay},\n  title = {As We May See: The World After Dashboards},\n  date = {2022-04-01},\n  url = {https://chrisvoncsefalvay.com/posts/as-we-may-see},\n  langid = {en-GB}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nChris von Csefalvay. 2022. “As We May See: The World After\nDashboards.” April 1, 2022. https://chrisvoncsefalvay.com/posts/as-we-may-see."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Every year, the Commandant of the Marine Corps publishes a reading list of books that often only bear on warfighting tangentially at best. The idea behind this is that those entrusted with the lives of servicemembers should have an understanding of the world that goes beyond the profession of arms.\nIn much the same way, I have been advising data scientists to go beyond professional literature. Below are the five books every data scientist should have read. As a profession, we are increasingly tackling morally complex issues. In the context of nuclear weapons, General Omar Bradley referred to nuclear giants but ethical infants. In a world that is shaped by data, and those who work with it, more than it has ever been in the history of humankind, may we take this chance to grow not only in skill but also in ethics, professionalism and humanity.\n\nAlexander Solzhenitsyn: In the First Circle\nSolzhenitsyn’s most famous books, such as A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich and The Gulag Archipelago, deal with the every-day privations of Soviet prison camps. In the First Circle is different: its characters exist literally in a limbo (the ‘First Circle’ of Dante’s Inferno of the righteous but unbaptised souls), subject to repression by the regime on one hand but due to their scientific knowledge, valued as workers in a sharashka, a ‘special engineering bureau’ staffed by prisoner scientists. In his Gulag books, Solzhenitsyn asks what it means to be human in a system of calculated inhuman repression. In the First Circle, his question is more specific: what does it mean to be a scientist in an unjust regime, and what compromises a scientist should not make, even if the cost is their freedom or their very survival. As AI and ML is increasingly used by tyrannical regimes as a tool of political repression, Solzhenitsyn’s In the First Circle speaks as loudly to today’s data scientists as it did to the Soviet and Western scientists who first read it in samizdat copies in the late 1960.\n\n\nThornton Wilder: The Bridge of San Luis Rey\nWilder’s The Bridge of San Luis Rey might well be the first novel to feature a data scientist (of sorts) as a protagonist – the best part of a century before data science as such existed. Brother Juniper, an Italian monk in Peru, witnesses the collapse of an Inca rope bridge, leading to the death of five people. He devotes his following years to unraveling the mystery behind what seems random and senseless at first – why did these five people die, and why didn’t others? What made them special? He goes about this in much the same way as we would in any current problem: by gathering information on the decedents, and try to find what common factors set them apart. Wilder’s book is about a lot of things – not the least fate, randomness and our innate expectation of an ordered universe.\n\n\nDavid Halberstam: The Best and the Brightest\nRobert S. McNamara was nicknamed the Electric Brain for his almost preternatural grasp of quantitation. McGeorge Bundy was a foreign policy prodigy. JFK inspired Americans in a way few other Presidents have, before or after. The list goes on and on – JFK’s and later Lyndon B. Johnson’s cabinet was full of men of exceptional intelligence, knowledge, education and sophistication. And yet, in the face of a mounting crisis in Vietnam, they were worse than powerless: they contributed the worst shortcomings of their thinking to the problem that eventually embroiled America in a hopeless conflict. Halberstam’s The Best and the Brightest is a story of good people making bad decisions, the psychological pitfalls of interpreting the world not as it is but as we wished it to be to conform to our innermost prejudices. In the end, the ‘best and the brightest’ of America, together with prodigious amounts of information and data, missed the opportunity to prevent the fall of South Viet Nam to the Communists. The drama of Vietnam played out on the world stage, but the same cognitive biases Halberstam describes are at work in boardrooms, data science teams and decision-makers’ offices every single day.\n\n\nFrank Herbert: The Dosadi Experiment\nHerbert’s The Dosadi Experiment should be required reading in Responsible Conduct of Research courses. The book deals with a perennial question: is it ethical to allow an injustice to a small number of individuals to continue if it protects an entire populated universe from potentially disastrous upheaval? Because this is Frank Herbert, there’s a decent amount of trippy 1970s sci-fi stuff, including ego sharing, tree bark like creatures that create FTL information transmission and dogs bred to be semi-sentient items of furniture. Taking those curves as they come, however, The Dosadi Experiment is a masterpiece, a weird-but-wonderful meditation on the rights of the many and the rights of the few, in a research ethics context.\n\n\nEric Schlosser: Command and Control\nIn 1980, a Titan II inter-continental ballistic missile of the US Air Force suffered a liquid fuel explosion inside its silo near Damascus, Arkansas – with a nuclear warhead on top. Schlosser’s book reveals that this kind of incident was, unsettlingly, much less infrequent than one might be comfortable with. What happens when the literal survival of the planet depends on technology, and how comfortable are we in replacing the human decision-maker – often enough, a twenty-something 1st Lieutenant in a missile silo’s command centre – with technology that may run away from us? Schlosser’s book is an impassioned plea for better design of critical systems, presenting the near-disasters of nuclear weapons – which ought to be the epitome of safety engineering! – as an indication of all that can, and does, go wrong.\n\nWhat are your favourite non-data science books for data scientists? Let me know in the comments.\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{csefalvay2022,\n  author = {Chris von Csefalvay},\n  title = {Five Non-Data-Science Books for Data Scientists},\n  date = {2022-04-13},\n  url = {https://chrisvoncsefalvay.com/posts/five-non-data-science-books-for-data-scientists},\n  langid = {en-GB}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nChris von Csefalvay. 2022. “Five Non-Data-Science Books for Data\nScientists.” April 13, 2022. https://chrisvoncsefalvay.com/posts/five-non-data-science-books-for-data-scientists."

    "text": "In the middle of the green and pleasant countryside of England lies a small piece of commons –– land, that is, over which a number of people share certain rights. In this hypothetical scenario, it’s six farmers, \\(F_1\\) to \\(F_6\\). Each of them has a hypothetical cow, which differs from ordinary cows in that it grazes a fixed unit, and produces a fixed amount of milk (unlike real cows, which vary wildly in their input and output parameters, or so I’m told). It is important to note that the land is a form of common property, meaning it is held by all of them jointly––or as ye olde Law Latin would put it, totum tenet et nihil tenet: they all hold the whole together, but no-one holds any specific part of it.1\nIf you are one of the farmers, you have a very clear dominant strategy: get another cow! Even better, get a handful. More cows equal more milk, and the land can sustain at least six cows.\nThe problem is, if all participants \\(F_{1...6}\\) pursue this individually dominant strategy, the sum of their outcomes will be inferior. Every player choosing the dominant strategy results in a worse outcome than it would if they had not chosen the dominant strategy. This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as the ‘tragedy of the commons’, but is in fact a simple result of an n-player prisoner’s dilemma."

In that sense the law does not distinguish between paying a ransom to, say, Boko Haram, who happen to be on the Treasury’s shitlist, or giving them the same amount of money due to an overwhelming conviction that boko is very haram indeed – it’s illegal either way. This makes paying a ransom needlessly complicated, especially as in my modest experience with kidnappers, they rarely discuss their organisational affiliations at length. With international jihad in particular being run on the franchise model in this day and age, it may well turn out that Joe Kidnapper, who held himself out as a common criminal, was in fact a full franchisee of al-Qa’ida, and suddenly the FBI is going through your underwear drawer.↩︎\nKidnapping, I am told, is expensive, and has to be funded in advance, with no guarantee that it will yield a payout at the end. The more complicated the operation, the greater the risk. The advent of the paseo milionario or ‘express kidnapping’ indicates that there is clearly a much reduced appetite for the risk involved with kidnapping. It is then no wonder that ransomware, which lacks many of the expensive and/or gory parts of kidnapping, is so much more favoured.↩︎"

    "section": "",
    "text": "As the new Omicron variant of concern of COVID-19 emerged over Thanksgiving week (of all times!), attention has been turning to Paxlovid (PF-07321332). If, like me, you torment yourself by perusing conspiracy theories, you might have heard it referred to as Pfizermectin. Behind that is the idea that the “COVID pill” Paxlovid is, basically, a re-packaging of ivermectin, a disproven treatment for COVID-19. (Popp et al. 2021)\n\nThe Pfizermectin Gambit\nThe Pfizermectin argument rests on the fact that Paxlovid, an oral treatment for COVID-19 (colloquially known as a “Covid pill”) is a protease inhibitor, and so is ivermectin. Consequently, so the reasoning goes, ivermectin is just as good — except it is no longer an economically viable drug, vis-a-vis Paxlovid. So, it is claimed, ivermectin was repackaged, and now sold at a premium.\nSo suggests, for instance, paleo-libertarian Lew Rockwell:\n\n\nBiden Admin Plans ‘Imminent’ Booster Expansion; Orders 10M Courses of ‘Pfizermectin’By Tyler Durdenhttps://t.co/IMckQeK541\n\n— Lew Rockwell ((lewrockwell?)) November 19, 2021\n\n\nThe problem is… Paxlovid is not ivermectin. It is not even similar, and the difference is crucially important to why Paxlovid is likely to be an effective medication, and ivermectin won’t.\n\n\nWhat’s different about Paxlovid\nAs always, there’s a kernel of truth in the overall lie. It is true that both Paxlovid and ivermectin are inhibitors of the 3-chymotrypsin like protease (3CLPro). 3CLPro is the principal protease of coronaviruses. It belongs to a wider class called mixed-nucleophile proteases superfamily A. Their main function is to find peptide bonds in proteins between glutamine on one hand and serine, glycine or alanine on the other.\nTo understand what’s going on here, we need to look at protein synthesis by viruses. A lot of the time, viral proteins are produced as one big, long protein called a polyprotein. Then, viral proteases break these at pre-determined cleavage sites into the constituent parts of what eventually becomes a viral particle. As far as the virus is concerned, interference with that cleavage is bad, bad news, essentially inhibiting the ability of the virus to create copies of itself that are effective infectious agents.\n\n\n\nPaxlovid (PF-07321332, in blue) bound to 3CLPro (volume model). Author’s own work, based on PDB:7SI9.\n\n\nThis ‘molecular scissor’ in coronaviruses is 3CLPro, and as such, it’s clearly a target of interest. Mody et al., in a paper that has earned its spot on my list of top 10 papers of 2021, looked at 3CLPro inhibitors, and found that around 50 µM (micromoles) of ivermectin were sufficient to achieve a 75% or so reduction in the activity of 3CLPro. (Mody et al. 2021)\nHowever, that’s actually bad news — because 50 µM is, actually, a lot. And therein lies the problem.\n\n\nThe (pharmaco)kinetic difference\nThe problem with ivermectin is very simple. In order for an enzyme inhibitor to be effective, it needs to reach a concentration where it inhibits the target enzyme enough to make a dent in the underlying process. The standard metric for this is known as \\(IC_{50}\\) — the concentration of the inhibitor required to inhibit enzyme activity by 50%. This value for ivermectin is somewhere in the realm of tens of µM for 3CLPro.\nOne µM of ivermectin weighs around 0.0875mg, so a 1 µM solution of ivermectin would have a concentration of around 87.5 nanograms per millilitre (ng/mL). To reach even a very conservative 5µM, you would need blood levels of 437.5ng/mL.\nAnd that’s a problem, because above 80 or so ng/mL, ivermectin is pretty toxic. (González Canga et al. 2008) To reach the lowest conceivable limit of inhibitory action on 3CLPro would require doses that are incompatible with… well, life.\nThe alleged ‘Pfizermectin’ achieves this efficacy at a nanomolar level – at a concentration roughly ten thousand times lower. (Owen et al. 2021) At that concentration, Paxlovid is still well within its margin of safety.\nThis is not by accident, by the way. Paxlovid is the product of rational drug design, using computer models to identify a small molecule drug that is not only effective against an enzyme target but also has favourable pharmacokinetics. Far from merely ‘repackaging’ ivermectin, as the Pfizermectin theory alleges, this is an entirely new drug. It is structurally novel, and bears little resemblance, if any, to ivermectin. It was designed from the ground up to be orally effective, and be so at doses that are safe.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn the end, action happens in vivo — in real, living beings. Ivermectin might be a workable drug in vitro, where the model does not have to account for the inconvenience of actually keeping the host organism alive and breathing. To many of us who have looked at the maths of it, it has been clear that with the inhibitory concentrations required by ivermectin, it is never going to transition from the bench to bedside. Ivermectin does have a mechanism that counteracts SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. It’s just that it is way too weak to be of any practical use.\nPfizer’s drug developers have solved this through molecular dynamics simulations and rational drug design (and, in fact, have released a paper on just how they did it, which is very, very cool).(Zhang et al. 2021). Paxlovid is the result of this development — and it is far from being ‘Pfizermectin’ or repackaged ivermectin.\nUntil now, much of the activity has been focusing on debunking misconceptions about the COVID-19 vaccine and sensationalistic tripe about the pandemic. As curative non-vaccine treatments are entering the market, it will be important to provide the public with the proof they need to dispel dishonest notions about the “Covid pill”. First and foremost among these is that the “Covid pill”, whether molnipiravir or Pfizer’s Paxlovid, is not a repackaging of ivermectin in any conceivable sense.\nAnd the strongest proof of that is the simplest, too: it works, in ways ivermectin is mathematically incapable of working.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nGonzález Canga, Aránzazu, Ana M Sahagún Prieto, M José Diez Liébana, Nélida Fernández Martı́nez, Matilde Sierra Vega, and Juan J Garcı́a Vieitez. 2008. ‘The Pharmacokinetics and Interactions of Ivermectin in Humans—a Mini-Review’.
